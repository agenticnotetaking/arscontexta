# fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases

This is the operational response to attention degradation. Since [[LLM attention degrades as context fills]], chaining multiple cognitive phases in a single session means later phases execute on progressively worse attention. The solution is straightforward: give each task its own session.

The mechanism is session isolation. Instead of running extraction → connection-finding → verification → maintenance in a single context, each phase spawns fresh. The first 40% of context — the smart zone — is where sharp reasoning happens. By isolating phases, every task starts in that zone rather than inheriting the depleted attention of whatever came before.

The coordination cost is real but manageable. Since [[intermediate packets enable assembly over creation]], handoffs happen through files rather than context passing. A work queue tracks what needs to happen next. Task files accumulate notes across phases so downstream tasks see what upstream discovered. This is more overhead than simply chaining phases, but the quality tradeoff favors isolation. And because [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]], each fresh session can orient rapidly through the relevant MOC rather than re-traversing the graph to reconstruct context — the MOC compresses topic state so the warmup cost of session isolation stays low.

The distinction matters for heavy versus light work. Semantic judgment, connection finding, synthesis — these require the smart zone. Mechanical verification, health checks, simple pattern matching — these tolerate degraded attention. So heavy phases get isolation. Light phases can batch. Session isolation architecture makes this distinction explicit: extraction, connection-finding, maintenance, and meta-review each get isolated sessions, while verification phases can run together. And once isolation handles the macro-level quality question, the micro-level question becomes sequencing: given that tasks will run in fresh sessions, which ORDER minimizes total overhead? Since [[batching by context similarity reduces switching costs in agent processing]], organizing the queue by topic similarity means the knowledge-worker agent builds domain understanding once and carries the pattern across consecutive tasks, rather than paying the full re-orientation cost each time.

Phase separation has precedent in cognitive science. The Cornell Note-Taking System's 5 Rs — Record, Reduce, Recite, Reflect, Review — are temporal workflow phases, not simultaneous activities. Each R represents a distinct cognitive mode: Record is pure capture, Reduce is compression, Recite is verification, Reflect is synthesis, Review is maintenance. The insight is that these modes interfere with each other when combined. Cornell separated them for humans; we separate them for agents. Because [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]], this phase isolation works across domains, not just research: capture, process, connect, and verify are genuinely different cognitive operations regardless of what the process step does. The skeleton explains WHY isolation works so cleanly — the phases are not arbitrary divisions of continuous work but structurally distinct operations that interfere when mixed. Agent-operated knowledge systems can extend Cornell's framework, adding meta-review as a meta-cognitive layer, but the core principle is the same: phases run better in isolation than in mixture.

This is a CLOSED claim — a design decision, not an open experiment. The underlying science (attention degradation for LLMs, cognitive interference for humans) is established. The response (session isolation) follows logically from both traditions. We could theoretically test whether isolation actually improves quality versus chaining, but session isolation architecture commits to this because the reasoning is sound, the cost is acceptable, and the cognitive science precedent strengthens confidence.

The practical implication: when tempted to "just run one more phase" in the current session, recognize this as false efficiency. Endless analysis (chaining phases) feels productive but degrades quality. The discipline of bounded sessions enforces action: end the session, spawn fresh, pay the overhead of reading context again. The second session's output will be better than the first session's tired output would have been. And since [[closure rituals create clean breaks that prevent attention residue bleed]], these session boundaries should be explicit rather than structural — writing what was accomplished and marking tasks as complete ensures the break is cognitive (residue released) not just mechanical (context window closed).

Session isolation is one of two complementary strategies for the same constraint. Since [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]], hook delegation reduces context consumption within a session by moving deterministic checks outside the context window entirely. Session isolation resets context between tasks; hook delegation avoids filling it with procedural work within tasks. Together they maximize the smart zone from both directions — one by clearing context, the other by not filling it unnecessarily.

The overhead of session isolation is not zero, though. Since [[attention residue may have a minimum granularity that cannot be subdivided]], each fresh session pays an irreducible orientation cost — loading CLAUDE.md, reading the relevant MOC, understanding the task file — that cannot be compressed below some threshold no matter how well the hooks and disclosure layers are designed. Session isolation trades one cost (degradation from context accumulation) for another (irreducible orientation overhead per session). The tradeoff remains favorable because smart-zone reasoning is worth the orientation tax, but it means the optimal session granularity is not "as small as possible" but "small enough to stay in the smart zone, large enough to amortize the orientation floor."

- [[attention residue may have a minimum granularity that cannot be subdivided]] — tension: session isolation trades degradation from context accumulation for irreducible orientation overhead per session; the tradeoff is favorable but not free, and optimal session granularity must amortize the orientation floor
- [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]] — complementary strategy for the same constraint: session isolation resets context between tasks, hook delegation reduces consumption within tasks by moving deterministic checks outside the context window; together they maximize the smart zone from both directions
