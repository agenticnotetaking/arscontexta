# derivation-engine

The methodology of the /setup wizard. Signal extraction from conversation, dimension resolution, cascade effects, coherence validation, personality derivation, and vocabulary transformation.

## Tensions

(Capture conflicts as they emerge)

## Open Questions

- What signal confidence threshold balances accuracy against conversation length?
- How should anti-signals be weighted in the derivation?
