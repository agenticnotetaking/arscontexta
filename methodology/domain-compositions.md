# domain-compositions

Worked domain examples showing how the 8 dimensions, vocabulary, and personality combine for specific use cases. Each example demonstrates a complete derived system.

## Domains

- [[therapy journal uses warm personality with pattern detection for emotional processing]] -- therapeutic journaling with mood-trigger correlation, ethical constraints, and growth tracking
- [[academic research uses structured extraction with cross-source synthesis]] -- literature reviews, claim extraction, methodology-comparable synthesis
- [[trading uses conviction tracking with thesis-outcome correlation]] -- trade journaling, strategy drift detection, conviction-outcome feedback loops
- [[creative writing uses worldbuilding consistency with character tracking]] -- worldbuilding consistency graphs, character tracking, timeline management
- [[project management uses decision tracking with stakeholder context]] -- decision documentation, stakeholder management, cross-project learning
- [[product management uses feedback pipelines with experiment tracking]] -- feedback-to-feature pipelines, experiment tracking, customer voice intelligence
- [[engineering uses technical decision tracking with architectural memory]] -- ADR tracking, dependency graphs, architectural memory across team members
- [[student learning uses prerequisite graphs with spaced retrieval]] -- prerequisite graph construction, mastery tracking, spaced retrieval scheduling
- [[personal assistant uses life area management with review automation]] -- life area management, goal tracking, habit formation, review automation
- [[health wellness uses symptom-trigger correlation with multi-dimensional tracking]] -- symptom-trigger correlation, training optimization, multi-dimensional wellness tracking
- [[legal case management uses precedent chains with regulatory change propagation]] -- precedent chain tracking, regulatory change propagation, cross-matter intelligence
- [[people relationships uses Dunbar-layered graphs with interaction tracking]] -- Dunbar-layered relationship graphs, interaction tracking, personal CRM

## Cross-Domain Patterns

(Patterns that recur across multiple domain compositions)

## Open Questions

- Which domain compositions stress-test the derivation engine most?
- What domain-specific failure modes need documentation?
