# operational wisdom requires contextual observation

Some knowledge is explicit — it can be stated as claims, reasoned about, linked. But effective operation also requires tacit knowledge: how does this community talk? What gets engagement here? What are the unwritten norms? How does this person prefer to communicate? These cannot be formalized upfront. They can only be observed and logged.

Claim notes capture explicit knowledge well. But since [[the vault constitutes identity for agents]], an agent's identity includes not just propositional claims but the accumulated operational understanding that makes it effective in specific contexts. Operational wisdom is part of what distinguishes one agent from another, and since [[agent self-memory should be architecturally separate from user knowledge systems]], this kind of knowledge belongs in the agent's own persistent space rather than mixed into the domain research graph.

## The Pattern

For any context requiring tacit knowledge:

1. Create an observation document — a dedicated place for dated, specific notes about the context
2. Log observations as they happen — what worked, what flopped, what surprised
3. Aggregate patterns over time — what keeps appearing?
4. Update behavior based on patterns — not rigid rules, but pattern-matching

This works for platforms (twitter, discord), communities (academics, practitioners), individuals (communication preferences), and domains (research norms, publishing conventions).

The pattern has a direct parallel in how the vault evolves its own infrastructure. Since [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]], schema fields crystallize through accumulated usage evidence rather than upfront specification. The same observe-then-formalize logic applies: you cannot predict which schema fields will earn their cost until the system is in use, just as you cannot predict which cultural norms matter until you have observed the community. Both resist premature formalization.

## The Acquisition Mechanism

How does tacit knowledge actually form? Since [[implicit knowledge emerges from traversal]], repeated exposure to the same paths builds intuitive understanding that bypasses explicit retrieval. An agent that has traversed twitter engagement patterns across many sessions develops a feel for what works — not through rules but through accumulated exposure. The observation log is the explicit complement to this implicit process: it captures what might otherwise remain unarticulated, making pattern-matching possible across sessions where implicit knowledge resets.

The concrete mechanism for this in the vault is the hook-driven learning loop. Since [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]], hooks nudge the agent to capture observations at session boundaries, observations accumulate as atomic notes, and when enough accumulate the meta-cognitive layer (/rethink) pattern-matches across them to revise methodology. This is operational wisdom acquisition systematized: observe, accumulate, pattern-match, adapt.

## Why This Matters for Agents

Agents operating on generic rules miss context. An agent that can read and adapt to cultural norms is more effective than one applying universal templates. Since [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]], the retrieval architecture determines what enters the context window — and if that architecture surfaces accumulated operational observations alongside domain claims, the agent reasons with contextual awareness rather than abstract principles alone.

The vault should contain operational wisdom, not just propositional knowledge. And since [[provenance tracks where beliefs come from]], the agent should track which operational insights were observed firsthand (high trust, slow decay) versus inherited from prompts (medium trust, worth testing). An observed pattern across twenty sessions of twitter engagement carries different epistemic weight than a single instruction about how to tweet.

Relevant Notes:
- [[implicit knowledge emerges from traversal]] — the acquisition mechanism: repeated traversal builds the intuitive understanding that observation logs attempt to capture explicitly; traversal produces tacit knowledge as a side effect
- [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]] — retrieval includes cultural context, so the architecture that surfaces operational observations shapes what the agent can pattern-match on
- [[the vault constitutes identity for agents]] — tacit knowledge is part of identity: an agent's accumulated operational wisdom distinguishes it from other instances with the same weights
- [[agent self-memory should be architecturally separate from user knowledge systems]] — the architectural container: operational wisdom belongs in the agent's self-memory space, not mixed with domain research claims
- [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]] — the implementation mechanism: hooks nudge observation capture, observations accumulate, and pattern-matching across accumulated observations drives methodology revision
- [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]] — parallel pattern: schema fields crystallize through accumulated usage evidence rather than upfront design, applying the same observe-then-formalize logic to data structures
- [[provenance tracks where beliefs come from]] — epistemic calibration: knowing whether operational wisdom was observed firsthand versus inherited from prompts determines how much to trust it
