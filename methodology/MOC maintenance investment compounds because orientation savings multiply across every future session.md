# MOC maintenance investment compounds because orientation savings multiply across every future session

There are two distinct compounding mechanisms in a knowledge graph, and conflating them obscures the strongest argument for maintenance investment. Since [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]], the graph compounds through connectivity — more nodes create more paths, and the marginal note increases the reachability of every existing note. But MOC maintenance compounds through a different mechanism entirely: temporal repetition. A single context phrase update costs perhaps thirty seconds of effort, but it saves orientation time in every subsequent session that loads that MOC. Because [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]], that orientation savings is not merely convenience but reduction of Leroy's 23-minute attention residue recovery cost — the cognitive tax of context switching that each maintained MOC compresses toward zero. If the MOC loads fifty times over its lifetime, that thirty-second investment returns twenty-five minutes of cumulative orientation savings. The graph compounding mechanism is spatial (more connections across the network), while the maintenance compounding mechanism is temporal (repeated savings across session boundaries).

This temporal multiplication is what makes maintenance the highest-leverage single operation available. Creating a new note adds one node to the graph. Connecting it forward during reflect adds edges. But updating a context phrase on an existing MOC entry improves the quality of every future traversal through that node — and MOC nodes are hubs, so they sit on more traversal paths than any individual claim note. Since [[context phrase clarity determines how deep a navigation hierarchy can scale]], each phrase refined through maintenance does not merely save orientation time but extends the depth the hierarchy can sustain. The compounding is therefore not only temporal but architectural: better phrases enable deeper hierarchies, which enable more efficient navigation at scale, which multiplies the savings further.

The argument strengthens when you consider the hidden second return. Since [[backward maintenance asks what would be different if written today]], MOC maintenance is not clerical work — the reconsideration mental model forces genuine intellectual engagement. The maintainer reads twenty notes in the context of each other, notices that two clusters are now in tension, writes a synthesis paragraph that did not exist before. Because [[MOC construction forces synthesis that automated generation from metadata cannot replicate]], this Jump-phase synthesis is a cognitive byproduct of maintenance that automated updating cannot produce. The ROI of maintenance is therefore double: measurable orientation savings (time saved per session multiplied by session count) plus less measurable but potentially more valuable synthesis opportunities (insights that emerge from reconsidering arrangements). Since [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]], the act of maintaining IS the thinking — the generation effect means the maintainer builds understanding through the maintenance act itself, not despite it.

The inverse case makes the argument from the other direction. Since [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]], deferred maintenance also compounds — but negatively. Every session that loads a stale MOC navigates by an outdated map. The agent follows paths to yesterday's understanding, misses recent work, and produces conclusions that look well-reasoned but rest on incomplete context. If fifty future sessions would benefit from a maintained MOC, those same fifty sessions suffer from a stale one. The asymmetry is worth noting: the cost of staleness may exceed the benefit of freshness because wrong navigation is worse than slow navigation. A slightly outdated context phrase wastes some time; a fundamentally stale MOC structure produces confidently wrong conclusions.

This framing has implications for how maintenance should be prioritized. The temporal multiplication effect means that maintenance on frequently-loaded MOCs returns more than maintenance on rarely-accessed ones. Hub MOCs like `knowledge-work.md` load in nearly every session, so every improvement compounds across the highest session count. Peripheral topic MOCs load less frequently, so their maintenance returns are lower. Since [[navigation infrastructure passes through distinct scaling regimes that require qualitative strategy shifts]], the compound returns argument is strongest in Regime 2 where manual curation is viable and the session repetition counts are high enough to amortize the maintenance cost. At Regime 3 scale, the temporal multiplication still holds, but the maintenance must shift toward automated detection with curated remediation because manual scanning cannot cover the territory — the compounding return per maintenance act remains high, but the feasibility of manual maintenance per MOC decreases.

The practical consequence is that MOC maintenance should not be treated as overhead to minimize but as investment to optimize. Since [[complete navigation requires four complementary types that no single mechanism provides]], the temporal multiplier differs by navigation type — global navigation (hub MOCs) changes rarely and loads in nearly every session, so improvements there have the highest multiplier. Local navigation (topic MOCs) changes frequently and loads in topic-specific sessions, producing moderate but still meaningful compounding. Contextual navigation (inline links) compounds through every traversal that passes through the updated node. Supplemental navigation (search index freshness) compounds less because search does not rely on manually maintained artifacts. The four-type framework maps directly onto maintenance priority: invest most in the types with the highest session-load frequency and the most trust-dependent navigation decisions.

The question is not "how little maintenance can we get away with?" but "which maintenance acts have the highest temporal multiplier?" A context phrase on a hub MOC that loads every session has a higher multiplier than a context phrase on a topic MOC that loads monthly. A synthesis paragraph that resolves a tension has higher multiplier than one that adds a routine entry. Since [[processing effort should follow retrieval demand]], maintenance budgets should flow toward the highest-traffic, highest-ambiguity navigation points — the places where improved clarity compounds most aggressively across future sessions. Session-load frequency is the demand signal: hub MOCs that load every session have the highest retrieval demand and therefore justify the most maintenance investment.

Relevant Notes:
- [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]] — distinguishes: that note describes compounding through graph connectivity (more nodes create more paths), while this note describes compounding through temporal session repetition (one maintenance act saves orientation across every future session)
- [[backward maintenance asks what would be different if written today]] — foundation: the maintenance practice whose investment this note argues compounds; the reconsideration mental model is the specific act that generates both orientation value and synthesis opportunities
- [[MOC construction forces synthesis that automated generation from metadata cannot replicate]] — explains the hidden ROI: the Jump-phase synthesis that maintenance forces produces insight beyond the orientation savings, making the actual return double what the temporal multiplication alone predicts
- [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]] — the inverse case: if maintenance investment compounds positively across sessions, deferred maintenance compounds negatively across the same sessions because every load of a stale MOC produces wrong-branch navigation
- [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]] — mechanism: MOC maintenance IS active transformation, so the maintainer builds understanding through the act of maintaining, not despite it
- [[context phrase clarity determines how deep a navigation hierarchy can scale]] — extends: each context phrase improved through maintenance contributes to depth-scaling capacity, so the compounding is not just temporal but architectural
- [[navigation infrastructure passes through distinct scaling regimes that require qualitative strategy shifts]] — scaling context: the compound returns argument is strongest in Regime 2 where manual curation is viable and session repetition counts are high enough to amortize maintenance cost
- [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]] — cognitive science grounding: Leroy's 23-minute attention residue recovery cost is what each maintained context phrase saves; that note establishes the cognitive mechanism, this note develops the compound returns from that mechanism across sessions
- [[processing effort should follow retrieval demand]] — operationalizes the prioritization argument: maintenance investment flowing to highest-traffic MOCs is a specific instance of demand-driven allocation where session-load frequency IS the demand signal
- [[complete navigation requires four complementary types that no single mechanism provides]] — maps compounding rates onto navigation types: global navigation (hub MOCs) compounds with the highest temporal multiplier because it loads in nearly every session, while supplemental navigation (search) compounds least because it does not rely on curated artifacts
