# reweaving asks what would be different if written today

The question "what connections should I add?" leads to a different activity than "if I wrote this note today, what would be different?" The first is mechanical: scan for links, add them. The second is intellectual: reconsider the entire note against current understanding. The question is only meaningful because [[digital mutability enables note evolution that physical permanence forbids]] — Luhmann couldn't implement "what would be different" because his paper cards resisted editing. We can ask the question AND act on the answer. Understanding (reassessing against current knowledge) must precede building (updating the note). Because [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]], the difference is not just stylistic. Mechanical link-adding produces no new understanding — it's rearrangement. Genuine reweaving produces something that didn't exist: a reframed argument, a sharpened claim, a newly articulated connection.

This matters because notes written last month were written with last month's understanding. Since then, new notes exist, understanding has deepened, and what seemed like one idea might now be three. A note about "knowledge graphs" written before understanding spreading activation models is incomplete in ways that link-adding won't fix. The prose itself needs rewriting. The deeper reason this matters is that since [[coherence maintains consistency despite inconsistent inputs]], an unreviewed note may now contradict newer understanding without anyone noticing — the temporal inconsistency that accumulates between sessions is precisely what backward maintenance exists to detect and resolve.

The reframe changes what actions become available. Adding connections is one option, but so is rewriting content when understanding evolved, sharpening the claim when [[claims must be specific enough to be wrong]] reveals the title is too vague, splitting the note when multiple claims got bundled together, or even challenging the claim when new evidence contradicts the original. Since [[backlinks implicitly define notes by revealing usage context]], one input to this reconsideration is checking what roles the note currently plays — its backlinks reveal which arguments elsewhere depend on this note, providing constraints on how aggressively the claim can be revised without disrupting the graph. Because [[summary coherence tests composability before filing]], catching bundling at creation time is cheaper than detecting it during maintenance passes — the summary requirement is an upfront quality gate that reduces later reweave burden. If [[maturity field enables agent context prioritization]], maturity status becomes a reweaving input: seedlings explicitly signal "this note needs development work," making them obvious candidates for the reconsideration pass.

Without this mental model, vault maintenance becomes a mechanical pass that leaves outdated thinking intact but organized. And since [[wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references]], maintenance carries an additional dimension beyond quality: it is the mechanism through which link commitments get fulfilled, reframing the backward pass from cleanup to stewardship. Since [[throughput matters more than accumulation]], what matters is the quality of what flows through the system, not the size of the organized archive. Reweaving ensures that existing content remains part of the living flow rather than becoming a graveyard of historical understanding.

The backward pass complements the forward pass: connection-finding links new notes to old ones, backward maintenance updates old notes based on new ones. This mental model is precisely why [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] — without the "what would be different" frame encoded in the workflow, maintenance degrades to mechanical link-adding that preserves the form while missing the substance. This is [[verbatim risk applies to agents too]] manifesting in the maintenance phase: an agent could add links that look like connections while never engaging the deeper question of what would be different today.

The per-note reconsideration has a system-level counterpart in reconciliation. Since [[reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring]], the reconciliation loop formalizes the "what would be different" question at the structural level: it declares desired state (all links resolve, all notes in MOCs, schema compliance) and periodically checks whether actual state has drifted. Where backward maintenance asks "what would this note look like if written today?", reconciliation asks "does the system still match what we said healthy looks like?" Both are drift-correction mechanisms, but they operate at different scales and use different detection methods — backward maintenance requires judgment (reading and reconsidering), while reconciliation detection is deterministic (counting, comparing, checking). And since [[three concurrent maintenance loops operate at different timescales to catch different classes of problems]], backward maintenance maps specifically onto the slow loop: the high-judgment reconsideration that only makes sense at weekly or monthly timescales, because description staleness and claim drift develop over the course of understanding evolution, not session-to-session. The medium loop's detection (orphan checks, link density) surfaces candidates for the slow loop's reconsideration, making the two loops cooperate: mechanical detection at one timescale feeds judgment-requiring remediation at another.

Backward maintenance is also an attention allocation decision in disguise. Since [[AI shifts knowledge systems from externalizing memory to externalizing attention]], the question "what would be different if written today?" is fundamentally about directing finite attention — which older notes deserve renewed focus given current understanding. The system externalizes this attention decision through maintenance targeting and scheduling rather than relying on the operator to notice what has become stale. The same question scales up to system architecture: since [[evolution observations provide actionable signals for system adaptation]], the diagnostic protocol asks "what would be different" not about individual notes but about the structural decisions themselves -- which note types would you still define, which fields would you still require, how would you organize navigation? The per-note reconsideration and the per-system diagnostic operate at different scales but share the same mental model: current understanding tests historical decisions.

Whether this holistic reconsideration is the optimal approach remains testable. Since [[gardening cycle implements tend prune fertilize operations]] proposes separating maintenance into three focused phases (tend/prune/fertilize), the question becomes: does the "what would be different today" frame that considers everything at once outperform focused operations that each start fresh? The gardening experiment tests whether cognitive focus per operation beats holistic reconsideration. A separate question is WHEN the reconsideration should happen — since [[spaced repetition scheduling could optimize vault maintenance]] tests whether newly created notes need more frequent attention than mature notes, the timing of reweave may matter as much as the method. Backward maintenance also sits squarely on the curation side of a deeper governance dilemma: since [[organic emergence versus active curation creates a fundamental vault governance tension]], every reweave is an active curation intervention that shapes the graph according to current understanding. The governance rhythm determines when curation interventions like reweaving are appropriate — too frequent and they suppress the organic patterns that organic growth would produce, too infrequent and the structural debt from outdated thinking compounds past the point of easy correction.

But there is a deeper question about WHO does the reconsideration. When agents run backward maintenance, they do the intellectual work of asking "what would be different." The human approves the proposals. Since [[cognitive outsourcing risk in agent-operated systems]] tests whether delegating all processing atrophies human meta-cognitive skills, backward maintenance may be particularly susceptible: the human never practices the act of holistic reconsideration, they only evaluate someone else's reconsideration. If the gardening experiment validates focused operations, smaller-scope human approvals might preserve more genuine judgment than approving one holistic proposal.

The same "what would be different" question operates at a higher scale too. Since [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]], reseeding asks this question not about individual notes but about the entire system architecture: what would this configuration look like given what we now know about how it gets used? Backward maintenance at the note level (reweaving) and backward maintenance at the system level (reseeding) share the mental model but differ in scope and intervention type. Reweaving can sharpen a claim, add connections, split a note. Reseeding restructures templates, pipelines, and MOC hierarchy. The scale difference matters because systemic incoherence — schemas that have drifted, navigation that no longer matches content — cannot be fixed by improving individual notes, no matter how thorough the reweave.

There is also a cross-deployment dimension. Since [[the derivation engine improves recursively as deployed systems generate observations]], the backward maintenance performed within each individual system generates the operational observations that improve derivation for all future systems. When a reweave sharpens a claim or surfaces a tension, that observation enriches the shared claim graph — making backward maintenance not just a local quality practice but a data-generation mechanism for the derivation engine's recursive improvement. The individual system benefits from better notes; the meta-system benefits from better claims.

The question of WHERE activation should spread during reweave has a concrete answer. Since [[maintenance targeting should prioritize mechanism and theory notes]], productive targets are notes about the MECHANISM being reconsidered, not just notes in the same MOC. For experiments testing theories, the theory notes themselves are the high-value reweave targets because they provide the grounding the experiment tests against.

- [[verbatim risk applies to agents too]] — tests whether agents can produce maintenance passes that look like reweaving (adding links) while skipping genuine reconsideration; mechanical link-adding is verbatim risk in the backward pass
- [[AI shifts knowledge systems from externalizing memory to externalizing attention]] — paradigm frame: backward maintenance is an attention allocation decision — which older notes deserve renewed focus given current understanding; the system externalizes this attention direction rather than relying on the operator to notice staleness
- [[wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references]] — adds a motivational reframe: maintenance is not just holistic reconsideration of outdated thinking but stewardship of commitments; every dangling link is a promise that backward maintenance helps fulfill, shifting the frame from cleanup to obligation
- [[evolution observations provide actionable signals for system adaptation]] — the system-level counterpart: this note asks what would be different at the note level, the diagnostic protocol asks what would be different at the system-architecture level, monitoring whether structural decisions (types, fields, MOCs, processing) still match operational reality
- [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]] — scale extension: the same mental model at system level becomes reseeding, which asks what the entire architecture would look like given operational experience; note-level reweaving and system-level reseeding share the question but differ in scope and intervention type
- [[organic emergence versus active curation creates a fundamental vault governance tension]] — governance frame: backward maintenance is the primary mechanism of the curation pole, and the governance rhythm determines when reweaving interventions are appropriate; too frequent curation suppresses organic growth, too infrequent lets structural debt compound

- [[reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring]] — system-level counterpart: backward maintenance asks what would be different per-note through judgment, reconciliation asks whether structural health has drifted through deterministic comparison; both are drift-correction mechanisms at different scales
- [[three concurrent maintenance loops operate at different timescales to catch different classes of problems]] — scheduling container: backward maintenance is the slow loop's remediation operation requiring high judgment, while medium-loop detection (orphan checks, link density) surfaces the candidates that the slow loop reconsiders
- [[friction reveals architecture]] — the trigger signal: friction in use is what surfaces which notes need the reconsideration pass; agents especially benefit because they cannot push through friction with intuition, forcing the articulation that backward maintenance requires
- [[coherence maintains consistency despite inconsistent inputs]] — the belief-level goal: backward maintenance serves coherence by detecting and resolving contradictions that accumulate as understanding evolves; the reconsideration question is ultimately asking whether the note still coheres with the current belief system
