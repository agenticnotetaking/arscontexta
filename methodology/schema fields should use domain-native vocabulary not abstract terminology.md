# schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology

A therapist thinks in terms of "triggers," "coping strategies," and "session reflections." An abstract knowledge system asks for "antecedent_conditions," "intervention_methods," and "processing_notes." Both might capture the same information, but the therapist will fill the first set of fields reliably and abandon the second. The vocabulary gap is not cosmetic — it is the primary adoption barrier for derived knowledge systems, because every interaction with the system forces a translation step that erodes trust and increases cognitive load.

This is an extension of the principle that since [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]], pre-defined fields shift decisions from design to execution. But schema templates can reduce structural overhead while simultaneously increasing linguistic overhead if the field names require mental translation. A therapist confronted with `antecedent_conditions:` must first recall what that means in their professional vocabulary, then translate their thinking into the system's terms, then fill the field. Each translation step consumes working memory that should be directed at content. Domain-native vocabulary eliminates this translation entirely — when the field says "triggers," the therapist can fill it from their natural professional thinking without detour.

The scope of this principle extends well beyond field names. Since [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]], the universal pipeline — capture, process, connect, verify — provides structure that every derived system inherits. But the names attached to each phase should speak the domain's language. A therapy system should call its process step "pattern recognition" or "insight extraction," not "claim extraction." A project management system should call it "decision documentation," not "synthesis." The skeleton is universal; the vocabulary wrapping it is domain-specific. This applies to MOC section headings too: a therapist's navigation says "Key Patterns" where this vault says "Core Ideas," and a project manager's says "Decisions" where this vault says "Claims." The structural function is identical, but the vocabulary must match how the domain practitioner naturally organizes their thinking.

The anti-pattern is well-documented: generic abstract terminology causes users to misunderstand fields, fill them inconsistently, or abandon the system entirely. Inconsistent filling is particularly insidious because since [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]], the entire information-theoretic justification for YAML frontmatter depends on consistent field values enabling precision-first retrieval. If some therapists interpret "antecedent_conditions" as triggers and others as environmental factors, the field becomes un-queryable — not because the data is missing, but because it means different things across entries, destroying the entropy reduction that metadata is designed to achieve. Domain-native vocabulary constrains interpretation naturally because practitioners share a professional vocabulary that carries agreed-upon scope.

Since [[narrow folksonomy optimizes for single-operator retrieval unlike broad consensus tagging]], there might seem to be a tension between domain-native vocabulary and personal vocabulary. Narrow folksonomy says the operator's idiosyncratic terms are optimal for retrieval. Domain-native vocabulary says the field's professional terms are optimal for adoption. But these operate at different levels. Schema field names are structural — they define the slots that content fills, and they must be immediately legible to any domain practitioner using the system. The content within those fields can be personal vocabulary, specific to the operator's conceptual distinctions. A therapist's "triggers" field might contain entries phrased in their own therapeutic language ("rejection sensitivity activation" rather than the textbook "abandonment schema trigger"), and that personal vocabulary within the domain-native schema is exactly the narrow folksonomy optimization at work. The schema speaks the domain's language; the content speaks the operator's.

Since [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]], vocabulary adaptation is what distinguishes genuine derivation from template distribution wearing a different label. A template might change folder names and call itself "customized." Real derivation reshapes every linguistic surface — field names, phase names, section headings, error messages, instructions — to match the target domain's natural vocabulary. When [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]], the adaptation step must include this vocabulary translation: mapping beekeeping to a project-health hybrid means replacing "sprint" with "inspection cycle," "milestone" with "seasonal goal," "stakeholder" with "colony," and "health metric" with "brood pattern assessment." Each substitution is a semantic mapping, not a find-and-replace, because the concepts may differ in scope even when they occupy the same structural role.

The deeper implication is that vocabulary carries ontology — and because [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]], vocabulary mismatch is often the visible symptom of a deeper operational mismatch. A therapy system that renames "claim extraction" to "insight extraction" but keeps the same decomposition logic has fixed the vocabulary while preserving the wrong operations. When a system uses "antecedent_conditions," it implicitly asserts that therapy operates through abstract causal chains. When it uses "triggers," it acknowledges the embodied, experiential reality of therapeutic work. The vocabulary choice is not neutral — it shapes how the practitioner conceptualizes their domain within the system. Domain-native vocabulary respects the ontology that the domain has already developed through practice, rather than imposing an abstracted ontology derived from systems theory. This is why vocabulary mismatch causes abandonment rather than mere annoyance: the practitioner feels the system doesn't understand their work, and that feeling is correct — the abstract vocabulary literally fails to encode the domain's conceptual distinctions.

There is a shadow side. Domain-native vocabulary makes cross-domain comparison harder, and since [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]], this cost materializes concretely when multiple domains coexist in one graph. The composition rules require field name prefixing to avoid conflicts — `project_status` versus `therapy_status` — which is the direct consequence of each domain using vocabulary native to its practitioners. This vault can query `rg '^methodology: Zettelkasten'` across all notes because it uses a shared vocabulary. If a therapy system uses "pattern recognition" and a research system uses "claim extraction" for structurally identical operations, cross-system analysis requires a translation layer that maps domain vocabularies back to structural functions. This translation is necessarily semantic rather than mechanical, for the same reason that since [[platform adapter translation is semantic not mechanical because hook event meanings differ]], adapter translation between agent platforms must decompose quality guarantees rather than rename events — concepts may differ in scope even when they occupy the same structural role, so vocabulary mapping must reason about meaning, not just substitute labels. The abstraction that domain-native vocabulary rejects at the user interface level may be necessary at the meta-analysis level. The resolution is layered vocabulary: domain-native at the surface where practitioners interact, abstract at the meta layer where systems are compared and analyzed. This vault's own practice reflects this — "Core Ideas" is the vault's domain vocabulary for what a generic system might call "primary entries," and cross-vault comparison would need to recognize that equivalence.

This layered approach also has a temporal dimension. Since [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]], the domain-native vocabulary itself should emerge through observation rather than upfront specification. When practitioners manually add fields with their own terminology — a therapist writing `triggers:` in free-text notes before any schema defines it — that organic vocabulary IS the domain-native signal the evolution protocol watches for. The evolution signals (manual field additions, placeholder stuffing, patterned free text) are more legible precisely because domain-native vocabulary matches natural professional thinking, making genuine usage distinguishable from compliance theater.

Relevant Notes:
- [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]] — foundation: domain-native vocabulary is a specific mechanism for reducing capture overhead, extending the general principle from structural scaffolding to linguistic fit
- [[narrow folksonomy optimizes for single-operator retrieval unlike broad consensus tagging]] — complementary vocabulary claim: narrow folksonomy optimizes vocabulary for the operator's mental model, this note optimizes vocabulary for the domain's mental model; both reject generic terminology for the same retrieval reason
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — the process that must honor this principle: derivation traverses claims to compose systems, and vocabulary adaptation is a mandatory step that distinguishes genuine derivation from template copying
- [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] — the adaptation step where vocabulary translation happens: mapping beekeeping to project-health hybrid includes reshaping every surface label from project vocabulary to apiary vocabulary
- [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]] — the skeleton that domain-native vocabulary wraps: capture-process-connect-verify is universal, but the names used for each phase should speak the domain's language
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] — surfaces the cross-domain cost: when multiple domains use domain-native vocabulary, field name conflicts and cross-domain querying require the prefixing and translation layer that the shadow side of this note predicts
- [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]] — temporal partner: domain-native vocabulary specifies what fields should be called while evolution protocol specifies when to formalize them; the observe-then-formalize signals (manual additions, placeholder stuffing) are more legible when vocabulary matches the practitioner's natural language
- [[platform adapter translation is semantic not mechanical because hook event meanings differ]] — structural parallel: both argue that translation across system boundaries must be semantic because surface-level equivalence hides meaning differences; vocabulary mapping between domains is the schema analog of event meaning mapping between platforms
- [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]] — downstream effect: domain-native vocabulary enables the consistent field values that make metadata an effective entropy reducer, because vocabulary mismatch causes inconsistent filling that degrades the precision metadata is designed to provide
- [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]] — the schema density dimension this note constrains: dense schemas amplify the cost of vocabulary mismatch because each abstractly-named field forces a translation step, so density and vocabulary quality are coupled
- [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]] — the deeper disease that vocabulary mismatch is a symptom of: renaming 'claim extraction' to 'insight extraction' fixes the vocabulary while preserving the wrong operations; vocabulary adaptation without operational adaptation is cosmetic derivation
