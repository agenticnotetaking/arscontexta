# self-extension requires context files to contain platform operations knowledge not just methodology

Self-extension is the property that makes context files function as operating systems rather than configuration -- since [[context files function as agent operating systems through self-referential self-extension]], the recursive improvement loop works because the context file teaches the agent how to modify the context file itself. But this recursive loop has a precondition that the general principle glosses over: the agent must know how to build things on its specific platform. Methodology knowledge alone is not enough. An agent that understands atomic notes, wiki link conventions, and processing pipeline principles but does not know how to create a hook, configure a skill, or define a subagent on its particular platform cannot actually extend the system. The loop stalls at "improve the instructions" because the agent lacks the construction knowledge to implement improvements.

This creates a content requirement for context files that is easy to underestimate. Universal methodology -- note design patterns, quality standards, connection-finding practices -- transfers across all platforms because it lives at the foundation and convention layers described by [[four abstraction layers separate platform-agnostic from platform-dependent knowledge system features]]. But the automation and orchestration layers require platform-specific construction knowledge. For Claude Code, the context file must explain how `.claude/skills/` files are structured, how `.claude/hooks/` configurations work, how `.claude/agents/` definitions are parsed, and how `.mcp.json` integrates external tools. On another platform, the same content shifts to different directory structures, handler formats, and skill metadata conventions. The methodology is the same; the construction manual differs entirely.

The resolution is modularity. A generated context file needs both universal sections (note design, quality standards, processing principles) and platform-specific sections (how to build hooks here, how to configure skills here, how to set up MCP here). This is not merely an organizational preference but a functional requirement: without the platform operations sections, since [[bootstrapping principle enables self-improving systems]], the bootstrapping loop cannot close. The agent can observe friction and propose improvements, but lacks the infrastructure knowledge to implement them. This modularity requirement is precisely what makes derivation the right production mechanism: since [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]], the derivation process composes universal methodology claims with platform-specific operations knowledge, producing context files that carry both layers with justification chains explaining why each section is present. A template approach would require maintaining separate templates per platform; derivation composes the same research claims with different platform operations sections based on the target tier.

The distribution consequence is direct: since [[blueprints that teach construction outperform downloads that provide pre-built code for platform-dependent modules]], an agent can only build from a blueprint if its context file has already taught it how to construct infrastructure on its platform. Blueprint readability presupposes platform operations knowledge — without knowing what hook events mean, how skill metadata is structured, or how subagents spawn, the blueprint's construction instructions are unreadable. This makes context file operations content the precondition for the entire blueprint distribution model, not just for self-extension.

This also explains why since [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]], skills are the output that validates whether the context file's platform operations content works. If an agent can read its context file and successfully create a new skill with correct syntax, hook configuration, and model selection, the platform operations manual is adequate. If the agent produces malformed infrastructure, the manual needs improvement. Skills serve as the functional test of context file completeness -- not just whether the methodology section is clear, but whether the platform operations section teaches construction effectively.

The construction knowledge itself is not monolithic. Since [[methodology development should follow the trajectory from documentation to skill to hook as understanding hardens]], the context file must teach three distinct construction competencies corresponding to each encoding level. Teaching how to modify the context file itself (instruction-level construction) is different from teaching how to create skill files with correct metadata and workflow structure (skill-level construction), which is different again from teaching how to configure hooks with correct event bindings and response formats (hook-level construction). Each level has its own syntax, conventions, and design considerations. And since [[the determinism boundary separates hook methodology from skill methodology]], the operations manual must teach the classification criterion that determines which operations belong at which level -- an agent that does not understand determinism as the hook-skill boundary will misplace operations, creating either brittle automation (judgment in hooks) or unnecessary cognitive overhead (deterministic checks in skills).

The content requirement also extends beyond file format syntax. Since [[platform adapter translation is semantic not mechanical because hook event meanings differ]], an agent that knows how to write a hook configuration file but does not understand what quality guarantee each event provides cannot perform the semantic reasoning that faithful self-extension requires. The operations manual must teach event semantics: what PostToolUse means (fires per operation, returns to conversation, runs outside context), what SessionStart achieves (orientation at entry, fires once), and how these differ from superficially similar events on other platforms. This is the difference between a manual that teaches syntax (write this JSON structure) and one that teaches construction (understand what you are building and why each property matters).

When the operations content succeeds, it enables a further compounding effect. Since [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]], the hooks that self-extension produces become the infrastructure for the learning loop: hooks enforce quality, nudge observation capture, and accumulate the evidence that triggers meta-cognitive review. The learning loop's functioning is itself downstream validation that the platform operations content was adequate -- if the agent can build hooks that participate in the learning loop, the construction manual taught not just syntax but the semantic properties that make hook-driven improvement possible.

But the content requirement faces a resource tension. Since [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]], budget overflow pushes methodology from skills back to context file instructions, which inflates the context file's content burden. The platform operations sections and the overflow methodology sections compete for finite context space. A context file that must carry both universal methodology, platform construction knowledge, AND overflow skill methodology faces attention degradation on all three fronts. This creates a practical ceiling: the more methodology that overflows from skills to context files, the less room remains for platform operations knowledge, which is precisely the content that enables the agent to create new skills and relieve the overflow. The tension is productive -- it forces generators to prioritize which operations knowledge is most essential for bootstrapping -- but it means context file completeness is a resource allocation problem, not just a content design problem.

Relevant Notes:
- [[context files function as agent operating systems through self-referential self-extension]] — establishes the operating-system quality of context files; this note identifies what specific content the operating system must contain to enable self-extension
- [[bootstrapping principle enables self-improving systems]] — describes the recursive improvement loop in general; this note identifies the precondition: the loop stalls unless the agent knows HOW to build infrastructure on its platform
- [[four abstraction layers separate platform-agnostic from platform-dependent knowledge system features]] — provides the structural framework for understanding which content is universal (foundation and convention layers) and which must be platform-specific (automation and orchestration layers)
- [[platform capability tiers determine which knowledge system features can be implemented]] — explains why different platforms need different operations manuals: the available infrastructure varies by tier
- [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] — skills are the output of self-extension, so the context file must teach how to create them; without this knowledge, the agent cannot encode new methodology
- [[methodology development should follow the trajectory from documentation to skill to hook as understanding hardens]] — construction knowledge is not monolithic but layered by encoding level: the context file must teach instruction writing, skill creation, and hook configuration as distinct competencies with different requirements
- [[platform adapter translation is semantic not mechanical because hook event meanings differ]] — platform operations knowledge must include event semantics (what quality guarantee each hook event provides), not just file format syntax, because semantic translation requires understanding the guarantees, not just the trigger names
- [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]] — the downstream validation: when platform operations content is adequate, the agent creates hooks that drive learning loops; the loop's functioning confirms the operations manual taught construction effectively
- [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]] — budget overflow pushes methodology from skills to context file instructions, inflating the content burden and creating competition between platform operations sections and methodology sections for finite context space
- [[the determinism boundary separates hook methodology from skill methodology]] — a specific content item the operations manual must cover: the agent needs to know which operations belong in hooks versus skills, which requires understanding determinism as a classification criterion
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — the production mechanism: derivation composes universal methodology claims with platform-specific operations knowledge, avoiding the template-per-platform proliferation by composing from the same claim graph with different platform operations sections
- [[blueprints that teach construction outperform downloads that provide pre-built code for platform-dependent modules]] — downstream dependency: blueprints require platform operations knowledge as a precondition for readability; an agent without construction competencies cannot interpret blueprint instructions, making context file operations content the enabling condition for the entire blueprint distribution model
