# schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce

The natural instinct when building a schema is to anticipate what fields you will need and define them all upfront. This feels responsible — thorough, forward-looking, professional. But it fails for the same reason that designing complex systems from scratch fails: you cannot predict which fields will actually earn their cost until the system is in use. Since [[complex systems evolve from simple working systems]], the evolutionary path applies to schemas just as it applies to architectures, and the mechanism is the same: since [[friction reveals architecture]], the discomfort of working with an inadequate schema is the signal that reveals where formalization is justified.

The concrete protocol operates on a quarterly review cycle with five specific signals, each mapping to an action:

| Signal | What it reveals | Action |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Fields being manually added that are not in template | Unmet demand for structure | Add to template, backfill existing notes |
| Required fields consistently filled with placeholder values | False compliance masking low demand | Demote to optional or remove |
| Enum values that no notes use | Dead options cluttering the schema | Remove from enum |
| Free text fields showing consistent patterns | Emergent categories waiting for formalization | Convert to enum |
| MOC structure grown beyond split threshold | Organizational strain from accumulated content | Split into sub-MOCs |

The first signal is the most important because it reveals genuine demand. When an agent or human repeatedly adds a `confidence` field to notes even though the schema does not require it, that repetition is evidence — twenty manual additions constitute a stronger argument for formalization than any amount of upfront reasoning about whether confidence tracking would be useful. The schema should respond: "You have added confidence to 23 notes manually. Add to template?" This inverts the usual design flow. Instead of specifying fields and hoping they prove useful, you observe what people actually record and formalize the patterns that emerge.

The second signal catches the opposite failure. When every note has `adapted_from: null` because the field is required but rarely meaningful, the schema is imposing ceremony without value. Placeholder stuffing is the schema equivalent of teaching to the test — compliance without substance. Demoting the field to optional restores honesty: notes that genuinely adapt a human claim can still record that provenance, but notes that do not are no longer forced to assert a meaningless null. Since [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]], the initial schema should be minimal precisely to avoid this failure — two to three required fields beyond the universal base give the system enough structure to function while leaving room for organic evolution.

The third and fourth signals are cleanup and growth respectively. Dead enum values accumulate as the system's understanding shifts — a methodology enum might include a tradition that seemed relevant during initial research but attracted zero notes in practice. Pruning keeps the schema honest about what the system actually contains. Conversely, free text fields that converge on consistent patterns are schemas trying to be born. If `status` values in tension notes cluster around three recurring phrases, that clustering is the evidence for an enum.

This approach has deep parallels with how individual notes evolve. Since [[incremental formalization happens through repeated touching of old notes]], a vague inkling crystallizes into a rigorous concept through accumulated encounters. Schema evolution works the same way at a higher abstraction level: a vague "maybe we need a confidence field" crystallizes into a required schema element through accumulated evidence of manual additions. Both processes reject the premise that you can design the final form upfront. Both rely on the system observing its own behavior and hardening the patterns that prove useful.

The safety net that makes observe-then-formalize viable is soft enforcement. Since [[schema enforcement via validation agents enables soft consistency]], the system can flag schema violations without blocking work. This matters because during the observation period — between initial deployment and the first quarterly review — notes will inevitably drift from the minimal schema. Hard enforcement would force premature decisions about what fields matter. Soft enforcement records the drift as data, and the quarterly review converts that data into schema decisions. The warnings log becomes the evidence base for evolution.

The relationship to derivation is sequential. Since [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]], the derivation process produces the initial schema configuration — choosing which fields are required based on the use case and platform tier. But derivation operates before the system has operational evidence. This evolution protocol governs what happens after deployment, when real usage generates the signals that no amount of pre-deployment reasoning could anticipate. Derivation gives the starting point. Observation gives the trajectory.

The quarterly review protocol is itself a reconciliation loop operating at schema scope. Since [[reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring]], the five signals are desired-state comparisons: the desired state is that every required field is genuinely useful (no placeholder stuffing), that the template covers what operators actually record (no manual additions), and that enum values reflect actual categories (no dead options). The quarterly cadence is appropriate because schema drift propagates slowly — a new template field does not invalidate existing notes overnight but over weeks of gradual additions. The reconciliation pattern explains why the quarterly review needs to be scheduled rather than reactive: schema drift is invisible between reviews because no single note creation triggers a signal. Only the aggregate pattern across many notes reveals that the schema hypothesis has diverged from operational reality.

There is a shadow side. Observe-then-formalize can become a rationalization for never formalizing. If the quarterly review is skipped, or if "we need more data" becomes a perpetual deferral, the schema stays minimal forever and the benefits of formalization — queryability, consistency, precision retrieval — never materialize. The protocol requires discipline: when the signal is clear, act on it. Twenty manual additions is not ambiguous. Four placeholder values in five notes is not ambiguous. The signals are designed to be unambiguous precisely so that the observation period has a clear exit condition rather than becoming indefinite postponement.

This patience principle has a structural parallel. Since [[methodology development should follow the trajectory from documentation to skill to hook as understanding hardens]], the same logic applies to different substrates: methodology should not be encoded at a higher guarantee level until usage proves it is deterministic, and schema fields should not be formalized until usage proves they are needed. Both reject premature encoding. Both rely on accumulated evidence to justify the cost of hardening. The quarterly review is to schema design what the skill-to-hook promotion is to methodology encoding: a gate that requires operational evidence before structural commitment.

The lifecycle context matters too. Since [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]], the schema evolution protocol serves as the specific feedback mechanism for the evolution phase. The five signals tell the agent whether schema adaptations are still incremental corrections that the evolution phase can absorb, or whether accumulated drift — fields that no longer match actual use, categories that have shifted meaning, templates that diverge from practice — has crossed into the systemic incoherence that triggers reseeding. Schema drift is often the earliest visible symptom of configuration incoherence, because schemas sit at the interface between system structure and daily use.

The deeper principle: schemas are hypotheses about what structure serves the system, and hypotheses should be tested against evidence rather than assumed correct. Because [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]], every schema hypothesis is simultaneously a hypothesis about domain adaptation — adding a field expands the system's domain-specific surface while the rest of the note format stays invariant. Upfront design treats schemas as specifications — declarations of what WILL matter. Observe-then-formalize treats schemas as living structures that evolve alongside the content they organize, formalized only when usage patterns provide the evidence that justifies the cost of maintaining them. And because [[module communication through shared YAML fields creates loose coupling without direct dependencies]], every schema change is implicitly a contract change — a field added or removed affects every module that reads or writes it, which means the quarterly review protocol must evaluate field evolution not just as metadata design but as interface design with downstream consumers. The reverse operation — removing fields when modules are deactivated — is the temporal complement: since [[module deactivation must account for structural artifacts that survive the toggle]], schema evolution adds fields when evidence justifies them while deactivation cleanup removes fields when the module that justified them is no longer active. Both follow the observe-then-act pattern, but removal has historically received less design attention than addition.

Relevant Notes:
- [[complex systems evolve from simple working systems]] — provides the theoretical grounding: Gall's Law at the system level says start simple and evolve; this note applies that principle specifically to schema fields with a concrete signal-action protocol
- [[incremental formalization happens through repeated touching of old notes]] — the note-level analog: notes crystallize through accumulated touches, schemas crystallize through accumulated usage evidence; both reject upfront perfection in favor of iterative refinement
- [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]] — the initial minimal schema this evolution protocol begins from: two to three required fields beyond the universal base, keeping capture friction low so the system can observe real usage before formalizing
- [[schema enforcement via validation agents enables soft consistency]] — the enforcement mechanism that makes observe-then-formalize safe: soft validation surfaces drift without blocking creation, giving the system time to observe patterns before hardening them into requirements
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — derivation produces the initial schema configuration, but this note governs how that schema evolves post-deployment through operational evidence rather than re-derivation
- [[evolution observations provide actionable signals for system adaptation]] — the broader diagnostic protocol: three of its six diagnostics (unused types, N/A fields, manual additions) overlap with this note's schema-specific signals, framing schema evolution as one domain within a system-wide observation-to-action protocol
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] — the vocabulary constraint on evolution: domain-native vocabulary makes evolution signals more legible because practitioners naturally use professional terminology when fields match their mental model, making manual additions and patterned free text easier to detect as formalization candidates
- [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]] — the schema evolution protocol is the specific feedback mechanism for the evolution phase: the five signals provide the concrete evidence that tells the agent whether schema adaptations are still incremental corrections or whether accumulated drift has crossed into systemic incoherence requiring reseeding
- [[methodology development should follow the trajectory from documentation to skill to hook as understanding hardens]] — shared patience principle applied to different substrates: just as methodology should not be encoded at a higher guarantee level until understanding hardens through use, schema fields should not be formalized until usage evidence justifies the cost of maintaining them
- [[configuration paralysis emerges when derivation surfaces too many decisions]] — shared solution structure: observe-then-formalize defers schema decisions until evidence arrives, just as configuration paralysis is resolved by deferring dimension decisions to sensible defaults; both reject upfront specification in favor of evidence-driven elaboration
- [[module communication through shared YAML fields creates loose coupling without direct dependencies]] — elevates the stakes of schema evolution: when YAML fields serve as inter-module communication contracts, adding or removing a field is an interface change that affects all consuming modules, not just note metadata; the quarterly review must evaluate field changes as contract changes
- [[module deactivation must account for structural artifacts that survive the toggle]] — the temporal complement: schema evolution formalizes fields when evidence justifies them, while deactivation cleanup removes fields when the justifying module is no longer active; both follow observe-then-act, but the removal side needs the same principled protocol the addition side has
- [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]] — elevates the stakes: because YAML field names are the sole channel through which domain knowledge enters the note format, every schema evolution decision (adding, removing, or renaming a field) is literally expanding or contracting the system's domain-specific surface
- [[reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring]] — scheduling architecture: the quarterly review is a reconciliation loop where the five signals are desired-state comparisons and the cadence matches schema drift's slow propagation speed
- [[friction reveals architecture]] — the perceptual principle underlying observe-then-formalize: friction at the point of use is the signal that reveals where formalization is justified, and agents benefit especially because they cannot push through schema friction with intuition
