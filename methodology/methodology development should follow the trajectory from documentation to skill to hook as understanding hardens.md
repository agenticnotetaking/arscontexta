# methodology development should follow the trajectory from documentation to skill to hook as understanding hardens

When a knowledge system discovers a new best practice, there is a temptation to encode it immediately at the highest guarantee level. If hooks fire unconditionally and since [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]], why not skip straight to hook encoding? Because the level of encoding should match the level of understanding. A pattern that is not yet well-understood will be encoded incorrectly, and incorrect automation is worse than no automation -- it creates confident, systematic errors.

The trajectory has three levels, each with a different guarantee profile. Instruction-encoded methodology lives in context files like CLAUDE.md. It depends on agent attention, which means it works reliably in the first 40% of context (the smart zone) and degrades as context fills. The guarantee is aspirational: the agent should do this if it remembers. Skill-encoded methodology lives in executable workflow files that contain quality gates, phase boundaries, and verification steps. Since [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]], the guarantee is reliable: when invoked, the skill enforces the methodology consistently. But the agent must still choose to invoke the skill. Hook-encoded methodology lives in infrastructure that fires on lifecycle events. The guarantee is structural: the check happens on every qualifying event regardless of agent state, attention, or intent.

The progression from instruction to skill to hook maps onto how understanding develops through use. A new best practice starts as a documentation entry because you do not yet know exactly when it applies, what edge cases exist, or whether it is even correct. Documentation is cheap to write and cheap to revise. You might add "always check for duplicates before creating notes" to CLAUDE.md and watch what happens. If the agent follows the instruction inconsistently, that itself is informative -- it reveals which contexts make the instruction hard to follow, which is data about what the skill version needs to handle.

The move from instruction to skill happens when the pattern has been exercised enough to reveal its internal structure. Since [[complex systems evolve from simple working systems]], the skill cannot be designed correctly on the first attempt. It needs the experience of manual or instruction-guided execution to reveal what the quality gates should be, where phase boundaries belong, and which verification steps actually catch errors rather than producing false positives. Since [[incremental formalization happens through repeated touching of old notes]], the same crystallization principle applies to methodology: vague instructions sharpen into precise workflows through accumulated friction encounters. Because [[friction reveals architecture]], the friction of following an instruction inconsistently is not a failure but a signal — it reveals what the skill version needs to handle, making operational discomfort the input to methodology evolution.

The move from skill to hook happens when the pattern has been exercised enough to confirm it is deterministic. Since [[the determinism boundary separates hook methodology from skill methodology]], only operations that produce identical results regardless of input content, context state, or reasoning quality belong in hooks. This is a high bar. You cannot know whether an operation is truly deterministic until you have seen it run many times across varied inputs. A schema validation check might seem deterministic until you encounter a note type where the schema is ambiguous. A naming convention check might seem deterministic until you discover that some titles legitimately break the convention for good reason. The skill phase reveals these edge cases; the hook phase encodes only the cases that have been confirmed.

Since [[hooks are the agent habit system that replaces the missing basal ganglia]], the trajectory mirrors how human expertise develops. A novice follows explicit rules (instruction-encoded). A practitioner applies structured workflows (skill-encoded). An expert has internalized the pattern so deeply that it fires automatically (hook-encoded, or habit-encoded in the human case). The parallel is not perfect -- human expertise also involves judgment that improves with practice, while hooks only handle the deterministic subset -- but the temporal progression from deliberate to automatic is the same. The trajectory's endpoint -- hook-level encoding -- is made reliable by a structural property of agent systems: since [[agent session boundaries create natural automation checkpoints that human-operated systems lack]], hooks fire at discrete boundary events rather than requiring continuous monitoring, which means the investment in promoting methodology to hook-level encoding pays off more reliably than in continuous systems where triggers depend on scheduling infrastructure that someone must remember to maintain.

The trajectory is also a bootstrapping loop. Since [[bootstrapping principle enables self-improving systems]], each level of encoding builds on the previous. Instruction-encoded methodology generates the operational experience needed to design the skill. Skill-encoded methodology generates the execution data needed to confirm which operations are deterministic enough for hooks. Hook-encoded methodology generates the context window savings needed to tackle more complex methodology patterns at the instruction level. The system lifts itself.

Not all methodology can complete the full trajectory. Connection finding, description quality evaluation, and synthesis across domains require semantic judgment that varies with each invocation. These operations should stay at the skill level permanently -- encoding them as hooks would produce rules applied uniformly to tasks that require contextual judgment. The trajectory describes the maturation path for methodology patterns, not a mandate that everything must become a hook. The question for any pattern is: has this been exercised enough that we understand it well enough to encode at the next level? If the answer is no, premature promotion creates brittle automation that is harder to fix than instruction-level methodology that simply gets followed inconsistently. There is also a safety filter: since [[automated detection is always safe because it only reads state while automated remediation risks content corruption]], detection-side methodology patterns can move through the trajectory faster because their failure mode is bounded -- a wrong detection hook produces false alerts, not corrupted content. Remediation-side patterns require more accumulated evidence before each promotion because their errors are self-concealing and compound through the system. And since [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]], there is also a capacity constraint on the middle tier: even methodology that is well-understood enough for skill encoding may stay instruction-encoded longer than understanding warrants because the platform's description budget cannot accommodate another skill. The budget forces triage -- which patterns earn their skill slot, and which remain in the context file despite being ready for promotion.

There is a category of knowledge that cannot enter the trajectory at all, not just one that stalls at the skill level. Since [[operational wisdom requires contextual observation]], tacit understanding of how a platform's community talks, what engagement patterns exist, or how a specific person communicates does not harden into encodable methodology — it accumulates as dated observations and builds toward pattern-matched intuition. The trajectory assumes knowledge can be stated as a rule, then encoded as a workflow, then automated as a check. Operational wisdom is not rule-shaped. It is the kind of understanding that improves agent behavior without ever becoming a deterministic procedure, and attempts to encode it prematurely would produce the same confident systematic errors that premature hook encoding creates — except at an earlier stage, because the understanding was never formalizable in the first place.

The trajectory has a spatial counterpart in the vault's architecture. Since [[four abstraction layers separate platform-agnostic from platform-dependent knowledge system features]], the convention layer (instruction-encoded standards) maps to the first trajectory level, and the automation layer (hooks and skills) maps to the second and third. The trajectory describes temporal evolution through these layers -- a methodology pattern moves from convention to automation as understanding hardens. This is why since [[knowledge system architecture is parameterized by platform capabilities not fixed by methodology]], initial parameterization should favor instruction-level encoding even on platforms capable of full automation. The trajectory determines the starting point; the platform determines the ceiling. And since [[platform capability tiers determine which knowledge system features can be implemented]], the ceiling itself varies: tier-one platforms can complete the full trajectory from instruction to skill to hook, tier-two platforms can reach skill-level but lack the hook infrastructure for the final promotion, and tier-three platforms are permanently instruction-bound. The trajectory is universal but the reachable endpoint is tier-dependent. And since [[self-extension requires context files to contain platform operations knowledge not just methodology]], the context file must teach construction competencies layered by encoding level -- instruction writing, skill creation, and hook configuration are distinct competencies that the trajectory sequences.

Since [[composable knowledge architecture builds systems from independent toggleable modules not monolithic templates]], the trajectory becomes concrete at the module level. In a composable system, modules fall into four categories -- foundation, convention, automation, orchestration -- and each category has a characteristic shipping format that maps directly onto the trajectory. Foundation modules (yaml-schema, wiki-links, atomic-notes) ship as files and naming guides because they are just conventions that any file-reading agent can follow -- pure documentation-level encoding. Convention modules (MOCs, inbox-pipeline, agent-memory) ship as methodology instructions that require a context file but no platform infrastructure -- still instruction-encoded, one step above raw files. Automation modules (validation, processing-pipeline, hooks) ship as blueprints that teach the agent to build platform-specific implementations -- skill-level encoding where the blueprint replaces manual construction. Orchestration modules (health-checks, agent-definition, context-file generation) require the most advanced platform features and ship as generated configurations -- the hook level, where the system itself produces the artifacts. The shipping format gradient IS the trajectory applied to module delivery: each layer encodes at a level that matches how well the pattern is understood in that domain.

This module-level application names a specific failure mode. Since [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]], the "premature orchestration" variant occurs when automation modules are added before the manual process is understood -- the processing pipeline produces false positives, validation rules catch non-issues, and the system generates confident errors because the pattern was encoded before its edge cases surfaced. The fix is to start with convention-layer encoding and promote to automation only after five or more manual executions confirm the pattern, which is why [[friction-driven module adoption prevents configuration debt by adding complexity only at pain points]] -- the five-repetition threshold operationalizes the trajectory's patience at the module level. Start with zero modules (just markdown files), add one at a time, and let each addition demonstrate its value before reaching for the next level of encoding. The composable architecture calls this "Graceful Addition" and grounds it in Gall's Law -- which is the same theoretical warrant the trajectory already draws from, now applied to the specific question of when and how modules should mature.

The patience principle has a mechanism: since [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]], it is observations accumulated at each trajectory level that generate the understanding needed for promotion to the next. Instruction-level methodology generates friction observations. Skill-level methodology generates execution data. The learning loop converts operational experience into evidence for or against promotion. Without this evidence pipeline, the trajectory would be an abstract principle rather than a grounded practice.

The trajectory also operates within levels, not just between them. Since [[nudge theory explains graduated hook enforcement as choice architecture for agents]], even after methodology reaches the hook level, enforcement strength should start at nudge and migrate toward block as evidence accumulates. This is the same patience principle applied at finer grain: a new hook warns before it blocks, because the understanding of which violations are structural versus qualitative hardens through the same observational process.

This patience matters because since [[over-automation corrupts quality when hooks encode judgment rather than verification]], premature trajectory completion IS the mechanism that produces over-automation. Jumping from instruction to hook without the intermediate skill phase -- where edge cases surface, where the deterministic subset becomes visible, where false positives get identified -- creates the kind of confident, systematic errors that corrupt the knowledge graph while metrics look healthy. And since [[hooks cannot replace genuine cognitive engagement yet more automation is always tempting]], each successful promotion creates pressure for the next one, making the trajectory's requirement that understanding must harden first a structural safeguard against the gravitational pull of automation.

The trajectory also maps onto a larger lifecycle. Since [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]], the encoding trajectory is a lifecycle within the evolution phase — methodology patterns seed as documentation in the context file, evolve through friction encounters into skills, and harden into hooks when understanding is sufficient. But when accumulated encoding decisions produce systemic incoherence (hooks that conflict with each other, skills that encode outdated understanding, documentation that no longer matches practice), the system needs reseeding at the methodology level: re-evaluating which patterns belong at which encoding level given everything learned through use. The trajectory's patience principle operates within a single evolution cycle; reseeding resets the trajectory for a new cycle with enriched understanding.

The practical implication is patience. When a new best practice is discovered, document it. When documentation proves insufficient (the agent skips it under load), encode it as a skill. When the skill has been exercised enough to confirm its deterministic subset, extract that subset into a hook. This patience is not slowness -- it is the recognition that each encoding level requires understanding that only the previous level can generate.

- [[automated detection is always safe because it only reads state while automated remediation risks content corruption]] — provides a safety filter for trajectory progression: detection operations can move faster through the trajectory because read-only operations have bounded failure modes at every encoding level, while remediation operations require more accumulated evidence before promotion because write errors are self-concealing and harder to recover from
- [[idempotent maintenance operations are safe to automate because running them twice produces the same result as running them once]] — adds a second prerequisite for the hook-promotion step: beyond confirming determinism, the operation must also be idempotent or guarded before it can safely fire as a hook, because hooks fire on events that inevitably repeat
- [[agent session boundaries create natural automation checkpoints that human-operated systems lack]] — structural foundation for the trajectory's endpoint: hook-level encoding pays off reliably because discrete session boundaries guarantee hooks fire at every qualifying event without depending on scheduling infrastructure or operator memory
