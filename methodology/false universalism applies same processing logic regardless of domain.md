# false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain

The universal processing skeleton — capture, process, connect, verify — is one of the strongest structural claims in the vault's derivation research. Since [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]], any domain's pipeline can be understood as an instance of this same shape. But universality of structure creates a seductive trap: if the shape is universal, why not export the entire pipeline, process step included, to a new domain? This is false universalism — confusing the skeleton's domain-invariant structure with domain-invariant operations, and it is the most insidious derivation failure because it feels like principled system design rather than a mistake.

The symptoms are immediately recognizable once named. A research vault's reduce phase extracts atomic claims from source material — that is a thinking-system operation specific to factual-analytical domains. When that same "extract claims" operation is applied to a therapy journal, the result is absurd: emotional reflections get decomposed into propositional statements that strip the experiential texture that gives them meaning. Similarly, a verify phase that tests whether descriptions enable retrieval makes perfect sense for a research synthesis vault where retrieval is the primary access pattern, but applying "description verification" to gratitude entries in a personal journaling system asks the wrong question entirely — gratitude entries are not retrieved by description search but by temporal proximity, emotional resonance, or ritual revisitation. The operation is technically executable but semantically empty.

The root cause is that since [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]], vocabulary carries ontology. But false universalism goes deeper than naming. A therapy system that renames "claim extraction" to "insight extraction" but keeps the same decomposition logic has fixed the vocabulary problem while preserving the operational problem. The insight extraction in therapy is qualitatively different from claim extraction in research — it involves pattern recognition across temporal entries, emotional resonance detection, identification of recurring triggers and coping strategies. These are different operations that happen to occupy the same structural position in the skeleton. The vocabulary mismatch is a symptom, but the operational mismatch is the disease.

This has practical consequences for the Ars Contexta mission specifically. The vault's pipeline — record, reduce, reflect, reweave, verify — is excellent for research synthesis. The reduce phase mines claims from academic and practitioner sources. The reflect phase finds connections via semantic search and graph traversal. The verify phase tests description quality for retrieval optimization. Every one of these phase implementations encodes assumptions about the domain: that content decomposes into claims, that connections are found through concept-level semantics, that retrieval happens through description-based search. Exporting this pipeline unchanged to a therapy journal, a project tracker, or a creative writing workspace would impose research-domain assumptions on content that operates under different rules. The danger intensifies in multi-domain vaults, because since [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]], the fourth composition rule — domain-specific processing — exists precisely to prevent false universalism from propagating across domain boundaries through a shared graph.

Since [[storage versus thinking distinction determines which tool patterns apply]], even the coarsest domain adaptation — recognizing whether the target is a storage system or a thinking system — prevents the worst false universalism. A storage system that gets research-style reduce phases is doubly mismatched: it neither needs synthesis (wrong system type) nor claim extraction (wrong domain operations). But the storage-versus-thinking distinction is only the first filter. Within thinking systems, the diversity is still enormous. A therapy thinking system synthesizes through temporal pattern recognition. A research thinking system synthesizes through conceptual claim extraction. A creative thinking system synthesizes through idea development and reference integration. Each thinking system needs its own process step even though all share the skeleton.

The remedy is what [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] describes: explicit knowledge type classification that channels each domain to the right reference processing pattern. When the derivation agent classifies therapy content as experiential (mapping to therapy-like processing) rather than factual (mapping to research-like processing), it selects pattern recognition over claim extraction — not because someone told it to, but because the knowledge type predicts which operations produce value. False universalism is what happens when this classification step is skipped, and the derivation agent defaults to whatever processing logic it knows best.

Since [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]], false universalism is also the failure mode of template-based thinking masquerading as derivation. Template distribution takes a working system, changes the folder names and field labels, and ships it as "customized." But if the processing logic is unchanged — if the therapy template still runs claim extraction because that is what the research template did — the customization is cosmetic. Genuine derivation composes from research claims, which means the derivation agent must reason about which process step operations serve the target domain rather than copying the operations it inherited from its own training context. When false universalism does slip through, since [[justification chains enable forward backward and evolution reasoning about configuration decisions]], evolution reasoning provides the corrective: a processing mismatch symptom traces through the justification chain to the specific claim that assumed research-domain operations would transfer, making the assumption visible and revisable rather than silently embedded.

False universalism also has a sibling relationship with [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]]. Where premature complexity deploys too much correct logic at once, false universalism deploys the wrong logic entirely. But avoiding one can trigger the other: a derivation engine that correctly identifies that each domain needs its own process step might then implement all domain-specific processing phases simultaneously, producing a system that is domain-accurate but overwhelming. The derivation anti-patterns interact, just as since [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]], importing one wrong processing decision cascades through linking strategy, verification approach, and maintenance cadence, amplifying the original mismatch across the full configuration space. The runtime detection mechanism is what [[evolution observations provide actionable signals for system adaptation]] describes: the processing mismatch diagnostic — output that sits unlinked because the process step was designed for a different kind of transformation than the domain needs — is the signal that false universalism has occurred, making it diagnosable even when the derivation reasoning looked sound.

The shadow side is that some universality in the process step is legitimate. Across all domains, the process step involves some form of transformation — raw input becomes structured output. The universal skeleton predicts this. The question is how much of the transformation logic transfers. At the highest abstraction level ("transform raw captures into structured domain artifacts"), every process step is identical. At the implementation level ("extract propositional claims and classify by methodology tradition"), almost nothing transfers outside research. False universalism confuses which level of abstraction is actually universal. The skeleton is universal at the structural level. The process step is universal at the functional level (it always transforms). But the specific transformation operations are domain-particular. The note format exhibits the same pattern: since [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]], the five-component architecture is structurally universal while domain knowledge enters exclusively through YAML field names — the processing pipeline and the note format both confine domain variation to a single well-defined insertion point, and false universalism is the failure to respect these boundaries. Derivation must operate at the implementation level, where the differences live, not at the structural level, where everything looks the same.

Relevant Notes:
- [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]] — foundation: the skeleton's universality is precisely what enables the mistake; because capture-process-connect-verify holds everywhere, it is tempting to assume the process step's content transfers too
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] — vocabulary mismatch is a visible symptom of false universalism, but this note identifies the deeper issue: the operations themselves are wrong, not just the names
- [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] — the remedy: knowledge type classification channels each domain to the right reference processing pattern, making adaptation explicit rather than accidental
- [[storage versus thinking distinction determines which tool patterns apply]] — the coarsest form of domain adaptation; false universalism ignores even this upstream distinction when it applies research-thinking operations to storage-oriented domains
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — false universalism is what template distribution produces when vocabulary is swapped but processing logic is copied unchanged
- [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]] — sibling anti-pattern: premature complexity deploys too much correct logic while false universalism deploys the wrong logic; avoiding one can trigger the other when domain-specific processing multiplies system complexity
- [[justification chains enable forward backward and evolution reasoning about configuration decisions]] — enables: evolution reasoning through justification chains is the diagnostic mechanism that traces processing mismatch symptoms back to the false universalism assumption that produced them
- [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]] — mechanism: dimension coupling amplifies false universalism because importing one wrong processing decision cascades through linking strategy, verification approach, and maintenance cadence
- [[evolution observations provide actionable signals for system adaptation]] — detection: the processing mismatch diagnostic (unlinked output) is the runtime signal that false universalism has occurred; the process step was designed for a different transformation than the domain needs
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] — context: multi-domain composition is where false universalism is most dangerous because cross-domain processing must avoid defaulting to one domain's process step for all domains
- [[the derivation engine improves recursively as deployed systems generate observations]] — the corrective mechanism: deployment observations reveal when universalized claims fail in specific domains, gradually teaching the engine which claims are genuinely universal and which need domain scoping
- [[configuration paralysis emerges when derivation surfaces too many decisions]] — sibling derivation anti-pattern: false universalism deploys the wrong logic while configuration paralysis presents too many choices; together with premature complexity (too much right logic), they form a trio constraining derivation from different directions
- [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]] — the note-format counterpart: at the processing level, domain specificity enters through the process step; at the note format level, it enters through YAML field names; both architectures confine domain variation to a single well-defined channel, and false universalism is what happens when the processing-level boundary is violated
