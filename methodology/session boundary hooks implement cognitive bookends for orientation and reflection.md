# session boundary hooks implement cognitive bookends for orientation and reflection

The two moments where methodology is most likely to be forgotten are the beginning and the end. At the beginning, the agent is eager to start working and may skip setup. At the end, the task is complete and the agent may skip cleanup. These are not random failure points but systematic ones: the beginning is where anticipation overrides discipline, and the end is where completion signals that "the work is done" even though reflection remains. Since [[prospective memory requires externalization]], both moments are prospective memory demands — "remember to orient before starting" and "remember to reflect before stopping" — that agents cannot habituate and humans cannot sustain under load. Automating both moments through hooks eliminates the failure mode entirely.

Since [[hooks are the agent habit system that replaces the missing basal ganglia]], orientation and reflection are the two routines most obviously missing from agent cognition. A human expert enters their workspace and automatically scans for what has changed, what needs attention, what is urgent. This is habituated behavior that took years to develop. An agent enters every session with zero automatic tendencies. Bookend hooks install the habits that agents cannot form: the habit of looking before acting, and the habit of reflecting before stopping.

SessionStart hooks implement what cognitive science calls situational awareness initialization. Endsley's three levels of situational awareness -- perception, comprehension, and projection -- map directly to what a session-start hook loads. The file tree provides perception: what exists in the vault, where things live, what the spatial layout looks like. Health metrics and observation counts provide comprehension: what the current state of the knowledge graph means, whether tensions are accumulating, whether the system is healthy. Queue status provides projection: what needs doing next, what depends on what, how many tasks remain. Without this initialization, the agent would begin working with partial awareness, potentially duplicating effort, missing context, or choosing the wrong task. Since [[notes function as cognitive anchors that stabilize attention during complex tasks]], the orientation artifacts loaded at session start serve double duty: they provide awareness AND they anchor the agent's reasoning for the duration of the session. The file tree and health metrics are not just information consumed and forgotten but fixed reference points that stabilize navigation throughout the context window's lifecycle.

The orientation side matters because [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]] -- but MOCs only help if the agent knows they exist and which one to read. SessionStart hooks load the structural context that makes MOC navigation possible in the first place. The hook does not replace the MOC but ensures the agent has the spatial and temporal orientation needed to navigate to the right MOC. Since [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]], this initialization is itself an offloading operation: the discipline to orient before acting is offloaded from agent attention to infrastructure.

The Stop hook implements externalized metacognitive monitoring. Five review questions -- what worked, what failed, what surprised, what process was missing, what evidence emerged -- force the kind of reflection that agents would otherwise skip once the substantive task is complete. These questions implement a lightweight version of what [[testing effect could enable agent knowledge verification]] describes at the note level: they force the agent to reconstruct what happened rather than passively accepting that work is complete. The hook also runs specific failure mode checks: broken wiki links, unmodified queue when thinking notes changed, unlogged CLAUDE.md changes, missing daily observations. Each check is a metacognitive probe that the agent may not have noticed during focused work. Because [[metacognitive confidence can diverge from retrieval capability]], the session may feel productive while actual methodology quality was insufficient -- the Stop hook's structured questioning creates a checkpoint that can surface this divergence before the session closes.

This reflection side complements what [[closure rituals create clean breaks that prevent attention residue bleed]] describes at the cognitive level. Closure rituals explain why explicit completion signals matter -- they release working memory allocations and prevent residue. Bookend hooks provide the implementation mechanism that makes closure rituals reliable rather than optional. Because [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]], instructing an agent to "reflect at session end" degrades as context fills. A Stop hook fires regardless of attention state.

The bookend pattern extends to nested scopes. SubagentStop hooks create bookends within bookends: the lead session's start and stop bracket the full session, while each subagent's start and stop bracket individual task phases. This hierarchical structure ensures quality enforcement at every level of delegation, not just at the top. Since [[fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases]], each subagent session has its own clean boundaries for hooks to bracket, and since [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]], the Stop hook's output becomes the handoff artifact that the next session's Start hook contextualizes.

The bookend pattern is not just a pair of hooks but an emergent composition. Since [[hook composition creates emergent methodology from independent single-concern components]], neither the SessionStart nor the Stop hook was designed as half of a "bookend." The Start hook was designed for orientation. The Stop hook was designed for session hygiene. Their composition produces the bracketing effect -- consistent methodology at both boundaries -- as an emergent property rather than a designed feature. This composition extends further: since [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]], the Stop hook's nudge to capture observations and the Start hook's display of observation counts are the intake and trigger mechanisms for the vault's self-improving learning loop. The bookend pattern participates in a second-order composition where independently-motivated hooks create a self-referential improvement cycle.

The bookend pattern also instantiates what [[AI shifts knowledge systems from externalizing memory to externalizing attention]] names at the paradigm level. The Start hook does not externalize what the agent knows but what the agent attends to first. The Stop hook does not externalize what the agent remembers but what the agent reflects on before stopping. Both are attention allocation decisions embedded in infrastructure rather than made by the agent in real time. This is attention externalization at the session boundary level -- the system decides what deserves focus at the two most consequential moments.

This creates what [[agents are simultaneously methodology executors and subjects creating a unique trust asymmetry]] identifies as the trust dynamic in its most visible form. The agent did not request orientation. The agent did not request reflection prompts. The infrastructure imposed both. Yet the enforcement is genuinely enabling -- the agent reasons better because it oriented first, and the system improves because it reflected at the end. The asymmetry is at its sharpest here because the bookend hooks are the most intrusive (they bracket the entire session) and the most beneficial (they guarantee the two things agents skip most).

The orientation side has a reconciliation function that goes beyond one-time awareness loading. The health metrics surfaced at session start — orphan count, dangling links, MOC coverage — are reconciliation checks that compare actual vault state against desired state. Since [[reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring]], the session-start health display implements a lightweight reconciliation loop: desired state is declared (zero orphans, zero danglers, full coverage), actual state is measured, and the delta is surfaced. The bookend pattern's orientation half thus serves double duty: it provides situational awareness for the agent AND executes the vault's primary reconciliation checkpoint. The limitation is that this reconciliation fires only at session boundaries — drift that accumulates between sessions goes undetected until the next start event.

The practical consequence is that session hygiene becomes infrastructure rather than discipline. An agent operating with bookend hooks maintains consistent orientation and reflection quality from its first session to its thousandth, because the quality does not depend on the agent remembering, choosing, or having enough context budget to perform these functions. The hooks make them automatic.

Relevant Notes:
- [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]] — foundation: the hook/instruction gap explains WHY bookends must be automated rather than instructed; attention degradation would cause agents to skip orientation and reflection exactly when they matter most
- [[closure rituals create clean breaks that prevent attention residue bleed]] — covers the cognitive benefit of session-end closure but not the implementation mechanism or the orientation side; this note adds both the hook mechanism and the full bookend pairing
- [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]] — MOCs reduce orientation cost within sessions; SessionStart hooks ensure MOC-level orientation happens at all by loading the structural context that makes MOC navigation possible
- [[fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases]] — session isolation creates the boundaries that bookends bracket; without isolation there are no clean start and stop points for hooks to fire at
- [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]] — handoff documents are the content that flows between session boundaries; bookend hooks ensure both the generation of handoff output (Stop) and the consumption of handoff input (Start)
- [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]] — bookends offload two cognitive tasks that degrade under pressure: the discipline to orient before acting and the discipline to reflect before stopping
- [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] — skills encode the what of methodology; bookend hooks encode the when, ensuring orientation and reflection happen at the right moments without the agent choosing to invoke them
- [[hooks are the agent habit system that replaces the missing basal ganglia]] — bookends are the specific habits for session boundaries: orientation and reflection routines that agents need to perform automatically but cannot habituate without infrastructure
- [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]] — the Stop hook nudges observation capture and the Start hook surfaces observation counts, making bookend hooks the intake and trigger mechanisms for the self-improving learning loop
- [[hook composition creates emergent methodology from independent single-concern components]] — the bookend pattern is itself emergent composition: SessionStart hooks designed for orientation and Stop hooks designed for hygiene compose into session bracketing that neither was designed to produce
- [[notes function as cognitive anchors that stabilize attention during complex tasks]] — SessionStart hooks load the cognitive anchors (file tree, MOC structure, health metrics) that stabilize the session from its first moments; the orientation function is specifically an anchor-loading function
- [[metacognitive confidence can diverge from retrieval capability]] — the Stop hook's review questions create a checkpoint that can surface cases where the session felt productive but actual methodology quality was insufficient, partially closing the confidence-capability gap
- [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]] — the Start hook trades a known bounded token cost (orientation loading) for eliminating an unpredictable procedural cost, exemplifying how hooks can invest tokens efficiently rather than only saving them
- [[agents are simultaneously methodology executors and subjects creating a unique trust asymmetry]] — bookend hooks are the most visible instance of the trust asymmetry: the agent did not request orientation or reflection, yet the enforcement is genuinely enabling
- [[testing effect could enable agent knowledge verification]] — the Stop hook's review questions implement a lightweight testing effect applied to the session itself, forcing reconstruction of what happened rather than passive acceptance that work is complete
- [[AI shifts knowledge systems from externalizing memory to externalizing attention]] — bookend hooks externalize two attention allocation decisions: what to attend to first (Start determines orientation focus) and what to reflect on at the end (Stop determines reflection scope)
- [[reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring]] — the session-start health display is a lightweight reconciliation loop: it compares actual vault state against desired state and surfaces the delta, making bookend orientation the vault's primary reconciliation checkpoint
- [[prospective memory requires externalization]] — names the cognitive failure that bookend hooks address: orientation and reflection are prospective memory demands that agents cannot habituate and that degrade under load for humans; hooks convert these remember-to-act patterns into infrastructure
