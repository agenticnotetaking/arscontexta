# wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references

Ward Cunningham embedded a norm into the first wiki that went beyond technical functionality. The social contract was simple: if you see a CamelCase word that should be a page but isn't, YOU are responsible for defining it. Not someone else. Not later. You, the person who noticed the gap. This peer-to-peer accountability made wikis self-organizing without centralized editorial control. No one assigned pages. No one triaged a backlog. The act of recognizing that a concept deserved its own page carried with it the obligation to create that page or at least to leave a link that flagged the work for the next person who cared enough to elaborate.

This is fundamentally different from how most collaboration systems handle incomplete references. A broken link in a document is a bug. A missing page in a CMS is a gap in coverage. But a dangling CamelCase word on a wiki was an invitation with an attached obligation. The link itself was the act of accepting responsibility. Because [[dangling links reveal which notes want to exist]], the demand-signal mechanism is already well-understood in this vault — frequency of dangling references predicts which notes deserve creation, and high-frequency dangling links predict future hubs. But the social contract adds something the demand-signal framing omits: the ethical dimension. Creating a link is not just flagging demand. It is making a commitment.

The translation to agent-operated knowledge systems is surprisingly direct but structurally different. In Cunningham's wiki, the social contract operated between peers. Any human editor could see a dangling link and fulfill the obligation, and the community's shared norms ensured that someone eventually would. The obligation was distributed across a community of equals. In an agent-operated vault, the obligation falls on the agent — specifically on whatever agent session encounters the gap. Since [[stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication]], agents coordinate through environmental modification rather than peer negotiation. The dangling link is a stigmergic trace, but unlike a pheromone that merely signals "work here," the social contract reframes it as "someone promised this would exist."

This reframing matters because it changes how agents should prioritize. A demand signal says "this is referenced often, so it's probably important." A stewardship obligation says "this was referenced deliberately, so someone judged it worth elaborating." The distinction is between statistical importance (many references) and intentional commitment (even one deliberate reference). An agent that creates a wiki link to a non-existent note is not just leaving a breadcrumb — it is staking a claim that the target concept deserves its own treatment, and the vault's integrity depends on that claim eventually being honored.

The pipeline already operationalizes this through the dangling link mechanism. When /reduce extracts claims and creates links to concepts that don't yet have notes, those links enter the graph as promises. When /reflect discovers that a new note should connect to a concept that hasn't been elaborated, the link is both a connection and an IOU. The work queue and maintenance cycles exist precisely to fulfill these obligations systematically rather than relying on individual agent sessions to remember them. Since [[ThreadMode to DocumentMode transformation is the core value creation step]], the social contract ensures that ThreadMode traces — dangling links left during chronological processing — eventually become DocumentMode content through the pipeline's transformation phases.

But the social contract introduces a tension that pure demand-signal thinking avoids. If creating a link is accepting responsibility, then agents should be deliberate about which links they create. Linking freely during capture (as the dangling links note recommends) is efficient for demand signaling but profligate for stewardship. Every link is a promise, and an agent that creates fifty dangling links in one session has made fifty promises it cannot fulfill in that session. The resolution lies in the vault's architecture: since [[agents are simultaneously methodology executors and subjects creating a unique trust asymmetry]], the stewardship obligation is not personal but systemic. The agent that creates the link and the agent that fulfills it may be different sessions — possibly weeks apart. The social contract transfers across sessions through the environmental trace itself. The link persists; the obligation persists with it. This is why the social contract works at all for agents: since [[prospective memory requires externalization]], an intention to "elaborate this concept later" would vanish at session end without an external trace. The dangling link IS the externalized prospective memory — a future intention encoded as a persistent environmental modification rather than held in a mind that will be cleared.

This is where the agent version of the social contract diverges most sharply from Cunningham's original. In a human wiki, the social contract relied on shared norms, community pressure, and individual reputation. You fulfilled obligations because you cared about the wiki and your standing within it. Agents have none of these motivational structures. They fulfill obligations because the pipeline routes them to do so — the work queue surfaces dangling links, maintenance scripts flag them, and /ralph eventually spawns a session to address them. The social contract, translated from human community to agent architecture, becomes infrastructure rather than norm. Because [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]], this transformation is not a degradation but an upgrade: human norms degrade like instructions — subject to forgetting, fatigue, and deprioritization — while pipeline infrastructure fires like hooks, systematically and without attention cost. The obligation is encoded in the system, not internalized by the agent.

This encoding has advantages. Human wikis suffered from social contract failures — dangling links that persisted for years because no one felt sufficiently obligated to elaborate them. The vault's pipeline ensures systematic fulfillment: dangling links surface during /review, get prioritized by frequency, and enter the work queue for processing. The infrastructure never forgets an obligation, never deprioritizes it due to fatigue, never ignores it because the topic seems boring. But the encoding also loses something. In Cunningham's wiki, the social contract carried judgment — a human editor decided not just WHETHER to elaborate a link but HOW, bringing interpretive depth that reflected their understanding of why the concept mattered in context. An agent fulfilling a queued obligation may create the note without the contextual understanding that motivated the original link. Since [[propositional link semantics transform wiki links from associative to reasoned]], the quality of stewardship matters: creating a target note that merely exists is weaker than creating one that fulfills the semantic relationship the link implied. Because [[elaborative encoding is the quality gate for new notes]], fulfilling a stewardship promise means connecting the new note to existing knowledge with articulated relationships, not just making a file that happens to match the link target. Stewardship without elaboration is the Lazy Cornell pattern applied to promise-keeping — the structural motion of creating a note without the generative work of integrating it.

The social contract also connects to the vault's constraint against creating wiki links to non-existent files — a rule that seems to contradict the dangling link philosophy. The resolution is that the constraint applies to finished notes (links in thinking notes should point to real content), while the social contract applies to the processing pipeline (links created during extraction may point to future content). The boundary is temporal: during active processing, dangling links are acceptable as promises. In the settled graph, every promise should be fulfilled. The social contract is the bridge between these two states — it names the obligation that transforms a tolerable temporary gap into an intolerable permanent one. Since [[orphan notes are seeds not failures]], orphans and dangling links are two faces of the same incomplete graph: orphans are existing notes awaiting outbound connections, dangling links are promised notes awaiting creation. The gardening view tolerates both as intermediate states, but the social contract adds urgency to the dangling links side — an orphan is a seed that might bloom, but a dangling link is a promise that must be kept.

Since [[federated wiki pattern enables multi-agent divergence as feature not bug]], the social contract extends to federated elaboration: when multiple agents fulfill the same dangling link differently, each version still carries the obligation to provide genuine treatment of the concept. Federation does not dilute stewardship — it distributes it, with each version responsible for making its interpretive contribution coherent and composable.

The deepest implication is about vault health. A vault where dangling links persist indefinitely is a vault where promises are broken — where agents created references they never fulfilled. Since [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]], every unfulfilled link is a broken edge in the graph, a traversal path that leads nowhere. The social contract reframes vault maintenance from cleanup (fixing technical debt) to stewardship (honoring commitments). The question shifts from "which dangling links should we fix?" to "which promises have we broken?"

Relevant Notes:
- [[dangling links reveal which notes want to exist]] — establishes the demand-signal mechanism this note reframes ethically: dangling links are not just signals to monitor but commitments to fulfill
- [[stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication]] — Cunningham's wiki is the shared origin: stigmergy describes the coordination mechanism, this note describes the obligation structure that makes the mechanism trustworthy
- [[federated wiki pattern enables multi-agent divergence as feature not bug]] — federation inherits the social contract: multiple agents can fulfill the same dangling link differently, but each federated version still carries the stewardship obligation to elaborate
- [[ThreadMode to DocumentMode transformation is the core value creation step]] — Cunningham's other key contribution: the social contract ensures ThreadMode traces (dangling links as chronological markers) eventually become DocumentMode content (elaborated notes with timeless claims)
- [[agents are simultaneously methodology executors and subjects creating a unique trust asymmetry]] — the social contract adds a third dimension: agents are not just executors and subjects but stewards who inherit obligations from the links they create, deepening the trust relationship
- [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]] — the addressing mechanism the social contract operates through: wiki links create the edges, the social contract ensures those edges eventually point to real content
- [[propositional link semantics transform wiki links from associative to reasoned]] — the social contract extends beyond existence to quality: stewardship means not just creating the target note but ensuring the relationship is semantically articulated
- [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]] — the mechanism behind the norm-to-infrastructure translation: Cunningham's social contract relied on human norms that degrade like instructions; the pipeline's work queue and maintenance scripts act like hooks, firing regardless of whether any agent remembers the obligation
- [[elaborative encoding is the quality gate for new notes]] — specifies what fulfilling a stewardship promise requires: not just creating the target note but connecting it to existing knowledge with articulated relationships; stewardship without elaboration produces structure without processing
- [[orphan notes are seeds not failures]] — the gardening view's complement: orphans are seeds awaiting connection, dangling links are promises awaiting fulfillment; together they describe two faces of the incomplete graph, one structural (missing edges) and one ethical (missing commitments)
- [[vibe notetaking is the emerging industry consensus for AI-native self-organization]] — the stewardship differentiator: embedding-based vibe notetaking tools create connections without obligation, while wiki link social contracts transform references into commitments that the pipeline systematically honors
- [[prospective memory requires externalization]] — mechanism: dangling links are externalized prospective memory; each link to a non-existent note encodes a future intention as a persistent environmental trace, which is the only way agents can maintain obligations across sessions given zero residual intentions
