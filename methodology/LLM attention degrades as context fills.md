# LLM attention degrades as context fills

This is established behavior in transformer architectures. As the context window fills, the attention mechanism must distribute across more tokens, and the quality of reasoning degrades. The effect isn't linear — there's a region early in context (roughly the first 40%, though the exact threshold varies by model and task) where the model operates at full capability. Beyond that region, performance drops progressively.

The mechanism is straightforward: attention is a fixed resource being spread thinner. Early context gets high-quality attention. Late context competes with everything that came before. This isn't a bug — it's how attention works. The model can't attend equally to 200K tokens the way it attends to 20K.

The degradation is not uniform across task types. Research on recursive language models shows that more complex tasks degrade at shorter context lengths — the "smart zone" is actually a family of curves indexed by task difficulty. Simple retrieval tasks tolerate longer contexts before quality drops, while multi-step reasoning tasks hit degradation thresholds much earlier. This means session isolation decisions should account for task complexity, not just context length: a synthesis task deserves a fresh context window sooner than a verification task would.

This has practical implications for agent workflows. Chaining multiple cognitive phases in a single session means later phases run on degraded attention. A synthesis task at the end of a long session gets worse reasoning than the same task would get with fresh context. The degradation is invisible — the output looks coherent but is shallower, misses connections, makes worse judgments. The degradation also amplifies the importance of what gets loaded into context in the first place — since [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]], the retrieval architecture that determines what enters the context window has higher ROI than model improvements precisely because attention is finite and degrading. Better processing of the same material yields marginal gains; different material yields different conclusions entirely.

The primary solution is session isolation. Since [[fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases]], heavy thinking phases get their own sessions, starting fresh in the smart zone. Light verification can batch because it doesn't require the same depth. But there is a complementary response: since [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]], deterministic quality checks (schema validation, auto-commit, index sync) can be moved entirely outside the context window, so they never compete for the attention that degrades. Session isolation addresses judgment work that needs the smart zone; hooks address mechanical checks that should not consume attention at all. Together they form a complete response to degradation — isolate what needs sharp reasoning, externalize what needs reliable execution. The handoff happens through files (work queue, task files) rather than context passing, so each session gets pristine attention for its task. Since [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]], the file-based handoff mechanism creates continuity from structure rather than capability — the agent doesn't remember, it reads. The briefing pattern lets isolation produce quality without sacrificing coherent progress on multi-step work. Since [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]], skills enforce these phase boundaries — they define what "one task" means and prevent the scope creep that manual execution allows when context pressure mounts.

Since [[queries evolve during search so agents should checkpoint]], context degradation adds a time dimension to traversal strategy. Checkpoints let you reassess direction while still in the smart zone. A search that fills context before finding what matters has degraded attention for the actual synthesis work. Frequent checkpoints early (when attention is sharp) reduce wasted traversal later (when attention isn't).

Since [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]], the "max depth" parameter in traversal (hard limit on traversal distance) is grounded in this attention constraint. You can't follow links indefinitely not just because of token limits, but because attention quality degrades as you load more context. The depth limit isn't arbitrary — it's where the smart zone ends.

The attention degradation principle extends to maintenance scheduling. Since [[spaced repetition scheduling could optimize vault maintenance]] tests front-loaded review intervals (frequent early, sparse later), the cognitive grounding is attention preservation: frequent short reviews while attention is fresh beat infrequent comprehensive reviews that strain later sessions. This is the same principle at a different scale — session isolation preserves attention within tasks, scheduled intervals preserve attention across sessions.

The attention degradation principle also has a structural dimension at the infrastructure level. Since [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]], skill descriptions consume context from the first token of every session, reducing the effective smart zone before any task-specific content loads. A knowledge system with generous skill descriptions pays this attention tax on every task, not just tasks that use those skills. This creates a second-order incentive for concise descriptions and for delegating deterministic checks to hooks — since [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]], the token savings from hook delegation are not marginal but compounding: each check delegated externally frees tokens that would otherwise be consumed by loading templates, comparing fields, and reasoning through validation logic, redirecting that budget from procedural work to the cognitive work that actually benefits from the smart zone.

The claim is CLOSED because it's established science about transformer behavior, not a testable hypothesis about our methodology. The system design assumes it and builds session isolation on top of it.

Relevant Notes:
- [[queries evolve during search so agents should checkpoint]] — checkpointing while attention is sharp prevents wasted traversal when attention degrades
- [[progressive disclosure means reading right not reading less]] — curation at each layer keeps context dense with relevant material, maximizing value in the smart zone
- [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] — skills enforce phase boundaries that attention degradation makes necessary; without skill constraints, manual execution would chain phases until context degrades
- [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]] — the max depth traversal parameter is grounded in attention degradation; depth limits where the smart zone ends
- [[fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases]] — the design decision built on this science: session isolation preserves quality by keeping each phase in the smart zone
- [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]] — the mechanism that makes session isolation practical: externalized briefings create continuity without persistent memory
- [[intermediate packets enable assembly over creation]] — packets are the artifact type that makes session isolation practical; handoffs through files instead of context passing preserve quality across the session boundary
- [[cognitive outsourcing risk in agent-operated systems]] — human parallel: human judgment may degrade through delegation the same way LLM attention degrades through context accumulation; both are invisible quality failures
- [[spaced repetition scheduling could optimize vault maintenance]] — applies attention preservation to maintenance: front-loaded intervals keep reviews in the smart zone rather than accumulating review debt
- [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]] — precision-first filtering reduces context pollution; pre-filtering to high-probability matches preserves attention for what matters
- [[notes function as cognitive anchors that stabilize attention during complex tasks]] — the intra-session response: notes loaded early in the smart zone serve as fixed reference points that the attention mechanism can return to even as overall attention quality declines
- [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]] — the second design response: session isolation preserves quality by resetting context, while hooks preserve quality by removing attention-dependent checks entirely; both respond to degradation but address different operation types (judgment work vs deterministic checks)
- [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]] — structural dimension: skill descriptions consume context from session start, reducing the effective smart zone before task-specific content loads, creating a second-order cost where infrastructure awareness taxes attention capacity
- [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]] — the within-session complement to session isolation: while fresh context per task resets the smart zone between tasks, hook delegation reduces context consumption within tasks by moving deterministic checks outside the context window entirely, compounding savings across a session
- [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]] — amplification: attention degradation makes retrieval architecture the dominant factor; because attention is finite and degrades, what enters the context window matters more than how it gets processed, making memory structure higher ROI than model upgrades
