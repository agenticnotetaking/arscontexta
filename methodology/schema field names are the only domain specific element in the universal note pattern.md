# schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern

The note architecture has five structural components: a prose-sentence title, YAML frontmatter, a body that develops reasoning, wiki links that invoke other notes, and a topics footer that anchors the note in the navigation hierarchy. When you examine these components across radically different knowledge domains — research synthesis, therapy journaling, relationship tracking, project management, language learning — every component works identically except one. Since [[note titles should function as APIs enabling sentence transclusion]], titles are always claims that function as prose when linked — they serve as callable abstractions regardless of whether the domain is research or therapy. The bodies always develop reasoning with connective words. The wiki links always create graph edges. The topics footer always connects upward to MOCs. Only the YAML frontmatter changes, and within the frontmatter, only the field names.

Research uses `methodology`, `source`, `classification`, and `adapted_from`. A therapy system uses `trigger`, `pattern_type`, `coping_strategy`, and `session_date`. A relationship tracker uses `person`, `interaction_type`, `follow_up`, and `last_confirmed`. A student's learning system uses `domain`, `mastery_level`, `prerequisites`, and `review_date`. The base fields — `description`, `topics`, and `type` — are universal across all of them. Domain-specific fields extend the base, and that extension is the entire surface area of domain adaptation for the note format.

This matters because it reveals how narrow the domain-specific channel actually is. Since [[knowledge systems share universal operations and structural components across all methodology traditions]], eight operations and nine structural components recur in every viable system — but at the note format level, the universality is even more extreme than the system level suggests. Since [[ten universal primitives form the kernel of every viable agent knowledge system]], the kernel defines what never varies — markdown files, wiki links, MOCs, descriptions, topics, validation, semantic search, self space, session rhythm. This claim sharpens that insight by identifying precisely WHERE domain knowledge enters the note format: not in the structural pattern, not in the linking convention, not in the navigation hierarchy, but exclusively in the metadata field names. The note pattern functions like a protocol with a fixed header format and a variable payload — the header (title, body structure, link format, topics) is the protocol, and the YAML field names are the payload that carries domain semantics.

The parallel to the processing pipeline deepens this. Since [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]], domain specificity enters the pipeline through exactly one phase. The note pattern mirrors this: domain specificity enters the note through exactly one component. Both architectures locate universality in the structural frame and confine domain variation to a single, well-defined insertion point. The processing skeleton varies at the process step. The note pattern varies at the YAML schema. Everything else is shared infrastructure.

This has direct consequences for system derivation. Because the universal components constitute roughly 80% of the note pattern's architecture, deriving a knowledge system for a new domain does not mean designing a new note format. It means inheriting the universal pattern and designing the domain-specific YAML extension. Since [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]], this design step is not trivial — the field names carry the entire burden of domain adaptation, so getting them wrong means the system fails to speak the practitioner's language despite its structurally sound architecture. A therapy system with `antecedent_conditions` instead of `triggers` has the right pattern but the wrong vocabulary, and because the field names are the ONLY domain-specific surface, that vocabulary failure is felt at every interaction. There is no structural adaptation to compensate for linguistic mismatch.

The implication for composable architecture is equally significant. Since [[composable knowledge architecture builds systems from independent toggleable modules not monolithic templates]], modules can vary the domain-specific element independently without disturbing the universal pattern. A `therapy-schema` module contributes its domain fields to the YAML frontmatter. A `research-schema` module contributes different fields. Because [[module communication through shared YAML fields creates loose coupling without direct dependencies]], these domain-specific fields serve double duty: they carry domain semantics for the practitioner while simultaneously functioning as inter-module coordination signals that other modules read without knowing about each other. Both modules sit on the same universal base — same titles, same body format, same wiki links, same topics. And since [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]], multi-domain composition works precisely because the shared graph operates on universal components (wiki links, MOC hierarchy) while templates isolate the only thing that varies (field names). The graph layer never sees domain-specific fields; it traverses through titles, links, and topics, all of which are domain-invariant.

Since [[progressive schema validates only what active modules require not the full system schema]], the validation layer can handle this cleanly because it only needs to scope which field names to check — the structural validation (does the note have a title, body, links, topics?) is universal and always applies, while field-specific validation (is `methodology` a valid enum value?) applies only when the relevant domain module is active. The narrow domain-specific surface means progressive validation has a clean boundary: universal structure is always validated, domain fields are validated conditionally.

There is a shadow side to this universality claim. It assumes that domain knowledge truly restricts itself to metadata and does not reshape body structure, linking conventions, or navigation patterns. But a therapy system might need temporal sequences in the body that research notes never use. A project management system might need decision trees that therapy journals would never contain. A creative writing vault might use wiki links to represent character relationships in ways that research synthesis never would. These domain-specific body patterns do not fit in YAML frontmatter — they operate at the content level, not the metadata level. The claim that only field names vary is accurate for the structural frame but may understate how domain knowledge infiltrates the body text and linking semantics. The resolution is that these body-level variations are stylistic rather than structural: the body is always prose that develops reasoning, even if the reasoning takes different forms across domains. The wiki links always create graph edges, even if the edges mean different things. The structural pattern holds; the content within the pattern varies — but content variation is not structural variation. This resolution has cognitive grounding: since [[the vault methodology transfers because it encodes cognitive science not domain specifics]], each structural component maps to a cognitive operation — titling encodes working memory chunking, body prose encodes elaborative reasoning, wiki links encode associative memory — and these cognitive operations are domain-invariant. The reason the structural pattern holds across therapy, research, and project management is that cognition itself does not change when the subject matter does.

Relevant Notes:
- [[ten universal primitives form the kernel of every viable agent knowledge system]] — foundation: the kernel defines the invariant base layer, and this claim explains WHY it stays invariant — the note pattern itself is universal, with domain specificity entering only through metadata field names
- [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]] — parallel structure: the processing skeleton is universal with domain-specific divergence at the process step, while the note pattern is universal with domain-specific divergence at the YAML schema; both identify the single narrow channel through which domain knowledge enters an otherwise universal architecture
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] — downstream consequence: because field names ARE the domain-specific element, getting their vocabulary right matters disproportionately; this note explains WHY domain-native vocabulary is critical — the field names carry the entire burden of domain adaptation
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] — architectural implication: because everything except field names is universal, multi-domain composition works by varying templates (which define field names) while sharing the graph layer (which uses the universal components)
- [[progressive schema validates only what active modules require not the full system schema]] — enables graceful handling of the domain-specific element: since only field names vary, progressive validation can scope to the active domain's fields without needing to understand the domain itself
- [[composable knowledge architecture builds systems from independent toggleable modules not monolithic templates]] — the mechanism that exploits this universality: composable modules work because they can vary the domain-specific element (field names) independently while inheriting the universal pattern unchanged
- [[knowledge systems share universal operations and structural components across all methodology traditions]] — extends: the eight operations and nine components are universal across traditions; this note sharpens that to the note format specifically, showing the fixed/variable boundary falls at YAML field names
- [[note titles should function as APIs enabling sentence transclusion]] — structural parallel: the protocol/payload framing parallels the API framing — titles are function signatures (domain-invariant), bodies are implementations, and both models explain why four of five components resist domain variation
- [[the vault methodology transfers because it encodes cognitive science not domain specifics]] — cognitive grounding: the reason four components are domain-invariant is that they encode cognitive operations (titling as chunking, body as elaborative reasoning, wiki links as associative memory) rather than domain semantics
- [[module communication through shared YAML fields creates loose coupling without direct dependencies]] — architectural consequence: the domain-specific field names simultaneously carry domain semantics AND inter-module coordination signals, making the single domain-specific channel also the system's communication bus
- [[maintenance operations are more universal than creative pipelines because structural health is domain-invariant]] — operational consequence: maintenance checks the invariant components this note identifies (title structure, link targets, topics presence, body format) rather than the domain-specific YAML fields, which explains why maintenance transfers completely across domains
- [[dense interlinked research claims enable derivation while sparse references only enable templating]] — upstream dependency: derivation-readiness requires atomic composability at the note level, and the universal note pattern this note identifies is what makes notes atomically composable across domains — the invariant components compose while only YAML fields adapt
