# prevent domain-specific failure modes through the vulnerability matrix

Knowledge systems fail in predictable ways. Since [[PKM failure follows a predictable cycle]], the plugin can anticipate and prevent most failures before they occur. This doc catalogs failure modes across domains and specifies prevention strategies the plugin implements.

This doc tells the plugin WHAT to watch for, per domain, and HOW to prevent it.

## The 7-Stage Failure Cascade

Knowledge system failure is not sudden. It follows a predictable cascade where each stage creates the conditions for the next. Early intervention prevents the later stages from materializing.

| Stage | Name | What Happens | Typical Onset |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Collector's Fallacy** | Content enters faster than it's processed. Saving feels productive. Inbox grows. | Days to weeks after setup |
| 2 | **Structure Mirage** | User organizes the backlog into folders and tags. Feels like progress but produces no understanding. | Weeks after Stage 1 |
| 3 | **Orphan Drift** | New notes are created quickly without connection-finding. The graph fragments into temporal layers that don't reference each other. | Weeks to months |
| 4 | **Schema Erosion** | Without enforcement, notes gradually deviate from schema. Fields go missing, descriptions go stale, enum values drift. | Concurrent with Stage 3 |
| 5 | **Navigation Breakdown** | MOCs become stale. Since [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]], agents follow outdated maps and miss recent notes. | Months after Stage 3 |
| 6 | **Retrieval Failure** | Users search for knowledge they know exists and cannot find it. Trust in the system drops. The vault feels unreliable. | Follows Stage 5 |
| 7 | **Abandonment** | The maintenance burden exceeds perceived value. The system is abandoned. Since [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]], this stage is almost always traceable to excessive complexity at Stage 0 (/setup). | Follows Stage 6 |

**The cascade is not inevitable.** Each stage has specific interventions. The critical insight: Stages 1-3 are low-cost to fix. Stages 5-7 require structural restructuring (/reseed). The plugin's job is to detect and intervene at Stages 1-3 before the cascade progresses.

### Early-Stage Interventions

| Stage | Detection Signal | Intervention | Plugin Mechanism |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 (Collector's) | Inbox count > 2x weekly processing capacity | Inbox pressure alert + processing pipeline activation | /health checks inbox depth |
| 2 (Structure Mirage) | Notes with tags/folders but zero wiki link connections | Flag "organized but unprocessed" notes | Orphan detection counts notes with topics but zero incoming links |
| 3 (Orphan Drift) | Orphan accumulation rate > 15% of new notes | Batch connection-finding pass | /recommend suggests reflect passes on unconnected notes |
| 4 (Schema Erosion) | Schema compliance < 80% on critical fields | Validation report with specific fix suggestions | /health runs schema compliance checks |
| 5 (Navigation Breakdown) | MOC links point to moved/deleted notes; MOCs not updated in 30+ days | MOC health audit with stale link detection | /architect proposes MOC restructuring |

**The principle:** prevention at Stage 0 (/setup) matters most. Since [[friction-driven module adoption prevents configuration debt by adding complexity only at pain points]], a minimal starting system prevents the premature complexity that makes the entire cascade more likely.

### Domain-Specific Cascade Manifestations

The same cascade looks different in each domain:

| Domain | Stage 1 (Collector's) Looks Like | Stage 5 (Navigation) Looks Like |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Research | Papers saved but unread, bibliography grows, highlights unextracted | Literature review cites sources whose underlying claims have changed |
| Therapy | Journal entries written but never reviewed for patterns | Pattern MOC lists triggers from 3 months ago, current triggers unlisted |
| PM | Meeting notes captured but decisions unextracted | Project MOC shows "active" decisions that were superseded |
| Creative | Worldbuilding ideas captured but never canonicalized | Character sheets contradict scenes written after the last canon update |
| Personal | Goals set but never reviewed, areas neglected | Life area MOC shows "active" status on goals abandoned months ago |
| Trading | Trade entries logged but thesis not tracked | Strategy MOC references market conditions that have changed |

## Agent-Specific Failure Modes

These failure modes are unique to agent-operated knowledge systems. They have no direct analogue in human PKM because they arise from the agent's relationship to the vault:

### Stale MOC Navigation

**The pattern:** MOCs are curated once then neglected. New notes are created but MOCs are not updated to include them. The agent trusts MOC-based navigation and treats unlisted notes as non-existent.

**Why it happens:** Since [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]], agents navigate by MOC and never "stumble on" unfiled items the way humans browse folders.

**Prevention:**
- Pipeline enforcement: /reflect phase MUST update MOCs as part of note creation
- MOC health check: compare notes with matching `topics` against notes actually listed in the MOC's content
- Orphan detection distinguishes "no topics field" (schema failure) from "topics present but MOC doesn't list note" (stale navigation)

**Monitoring signal:** Count of notes with `topics: [[some-moc]]` that are NOT linked from that MOC's content.

### Cognitive Outsourcing

**The pattern:** The agent processes vault content, keeps the vault healthy, surfaces insights — but the human stops engaging with the knowledge. The human outsources understanding to the agent. The vault stays healthy but the human's comprehension atrophies.

**Why it happens:** Agent processing makes knowledge work feel effortless. The human asks "what should I think about X?" instead of thinking about X. The processing pipeline produces insights, but the human never internalizes them.

**Prevention:**
- Processing pipeline requires human judgment gates — the agent proposes, the human decides
- Since [[the architect does not auto-implement]], evolution recommendations go to the human for approval
- Periodic prompts requiring human interpretation: "I detected this pattern — what does it mean to you?"
- In therapy domains (see [[therapy journal uses warm personality with pattern detection for emotional processing]] ethical constraints), the agent surfaces patterns but explicitly withholds interpretation

**Monitoring signal:** Ratio of agent-initiated changes to human-initiated changes. If consistently > 10:1, the human may be outsourcing cognitive work.

### Context Degradation Across Sessions

**The pattern:** Each agent session starts with partial context. Important information from previous sessions is lost because the context file doesn't capture it, session logs aren't consulted, or the agent skips orientation.

**Why it happens:** Since [[LLM attention degrades as context fills]], agents work within context windows. Cross-session continuity depends on orientation artifact quality (context files, session logs, MOCs). Poor artifacts create agents that repeat work, miss connections, and contradict previous sessions.

**Prevention:**
- Context file generated with domain-specific orientation protocol
- Session logging captures decisions and discoveries, not just actions
- Start-of-session orientation reads context file + recent session log + relevant MOC
- Pipeline handoff files carry state between phases explicitly

**Monitoring signal:** Frequency of duplicate note creation or contradictory notes across sessions.

### Processing Bias Accumulation

**The pattern:** The agent's extraction and connection-finding develops systematic biases over time. It favors certain connection types, over-extracts from familiar claim patterns, and misses novel insights that don't match established patterns.

**Why it happens:** Skills encode specific extraction patterns. Over many processing cycles, these patterns become self-reinforcing: the agent finds what the skill tells it to look for, and what it finds confirms the skill's approach.

**Prevention:**
- Periodic /rethink passes that challenge processing assumptions
- Domain example diversity — multiple reference domains prevent single-pattern fixation
- Human review of extraction results to catch systematic blind spots
- Since [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]], reseed provides a principled reset when processing bias becomes systemic

**Monitoring signal:** Declining novelty in extracted claims — new sources produce claims that increasingly resemble existing ones.

## Monitoring Signal Summary

The plugin should track these signals across all domains. When signals cross thresholds, /recommend surfaces them as actionable recommendations.

| Signal | What It Measures | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|-----------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Inbox depth | Accumulation vs processing rate | < 10 items | 10-25 items | > 25 items |
| Orphan accumulation rate | Connection-finding pipeline health | < 10% of new notes | 10-20% | > 20% |
| Schema compliance | Metadata integrity | > 90% critical fields | 80-90% | < 80% |
| MOC staleness | Navigation currency | Updated within 14 days | 14-30 days | > 30 days |
| Description quality | Retrieval effectiveness | > 80% pass recite test | 60-80% | < 60% |
| Agent/human ratio | Cognitive outsourcing risk | < 5:1 | 5-10:1 | > 10:1 |
| Cross-session duplicates | Context degradation | 0 per month | 1-2 per month | > 2 per month |
| Claim novelty | Processing bias | Novel claims > 50% | 30-50% | < 30% |

## Universal Failure Modes

These affect every domain regardless of content type:

### 1. Accumulation Without Processing

**The pattern:** Content enters the system faster than it's processed. Inbox grows. Unprocessed items create guilt. The system becomes a dumping ground.

**Why it happens:** Since [[throughput matters more than accumulation]], capture is easy and getting easier (voice transcription, AI-assisted recording). Processing requires effort and judgment.

**Prevention:**
- Inbox pressure alerts when unprocessed items exceed threshold
- Processing pipeline that reduces effort per item
- WIP limits on inbox size — since [[WIP limits force processing over accumulation]]
- Visual indicators of processing debt

### 2. Structure Without Processing

**The pattern:** Notes are filed into folders, tagged, and organized — but never synthesized. The system looks organized but contains no original thinking.

**Why it happens:** Since [[structure without processing provides no value]], organizing feels like progress but produces no new understanding.

**Prevention:**
- Processing pipeline requires transformation, not just filing
- Since [[generation effect gate blocks processing without transformation]], the reduce phase demands active transformation
- Health metrics that measure synthesis (new connections created) not just accumulation (new notes filed)

### 3. Orphan Note Accumulation

**The pattern:** Notes exist but aren't connected to anything. No incoming links, no MOC membership. Effectively invisible.

**Why it happens:** Notes created without running the connect phase. Quick captures that never get integrated.

**Important reframe:** Orphan notes are seeds, not failures. A note without connections is potential awaiting integration, not garbage requiring deletion. The metric that matters is the orphan accumulation RATE, not the absolute count. A steady-state of 5-10% orphans is healthy (recent captures awaiting processing). A growing orphan rate signals pipeline breakdown.

**Prevention:**
- Topics field required on every note (orphan prevention)
- Orphan detection in maintenance loop
- Reflect phase mandatory after note creation
- MOC update required as part of the note creation cycle

### 4. Schema Drift

**The pattern:** Notes gradually deviate from schema requirements. Fields go missing, enum values diverge, descriptions become stale.

**Why it happens:** Without enforcement, entropy wins. Each note cut corners slightly.

**Prevention:**
- Schema enforcement (see [[schema-enforcement]] guidance doc)
- Periodic validation passes
- Progressive schema — only enforce what's actually used

### 5. System Abandonment

**The pattern:** Elaborate system set up, used enthusiastically for 2-3 weeks, then gradually abandoned.

**Why it happens:** Since [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]], the system's maintenance burden exceeds its perceived value.

**Prevention:**
- Start minimal — since [[friction-driven module adoption prevents configuration debt by adding complexity only at pain points]]
- Early value delivery — show insights from the first captured content
- Low-friction capture — since [[temporal separation of capture and processing preserves context freshness]]
- Condition-based maintenance, not scheduled reviews

## Domain Examples

Every domain composition includes agent-native prevention strategies for its specific failure modes:

- [[academic research uses structured extraction with cross-source synthesis]] — Concept-orientation enforcement prevents source-oriented thinking; citation graph monitoring detects citation rot
- [[therapy journal uses warm personality with pattern detection for emotional processing]] — Automatic pattern detection prevents write-only journaling; emotional vocabulary density tracking catches over-intellectualization
- [[project management uses decision tracking with stakeholder context]] — Decision notes with mandatory `rationale` field prevent decision amnesia; action item staleness alerts prevent meeting action decay
- [[creative writing uses worldbuilding consistency with character tracking]] — Consistency graph with contradiction detection prevents continuity errors; thread tracking with resolution status prevents plot thread abandonment
- [[student learning uses prerequisite graphs with spaced retrieval]] — Active retrieval testing via recite patterns prevents illusion of competence; prerequisite graph validation prevents prerequisite blindness
- [[health wellness uses symptom-trigger correlation with multi-dimensional tracking]] — Automatic correlation analysis at data thresholds prevents tracking without analysis; protocol effectiveness review triggers prevent protocol inertia
- [[engineering uses technical decision tracking with architectural memory]] — Knowledge gap detection via undocumented system alerts prevents tribal knowledge; ADR assumption monitoring prevents ADR decay
- [[legal case management uses precedent chains with regulatory change propagation]] — Precedent chain monitoring for updates prevents precedent rot; multi-jurisdiction regulatory tracking prevents jurisdictional blindness

## Grounding

This guidance is grounded in:
- [[PKM failure follows a predictable cycle]] — the 7-stage cascade follows predictable patterns
- [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]] — the leading cause of abandonment (Stage 7 traces to Stage 0)
- [[structure without processing provides no value]] — Stage 2 (Structure Mirage) accumulates organization without synthesis
- [[throughput matters more than accumulation]] — processing velocity prevents Stage 1 (Collector's Fallacy)
- [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]] — domain-specific failures need domain-specific prevention
- [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]] — agent-specific failure mode: stale MOCs
- [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]] — reseed as escape valve when cascade reaches late stages
- [[friction-driven module adoption prevents configuration debt by adding complexity only at pain points]] — minimal starting systems prevent cascade onset
