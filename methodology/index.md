# index

The Ars Contexta research substrate. This vault contains the research claims, operational guidance, and worked domain examples that power the plugin's derivation engine.

## Research Areas

- [[graph-structure]] -- how wiki-linked vaults work as graph databases
- [[agent-cognition]] -- cognitive science foundations for agent-operated knowledge systems
- [[discovery-retrieval]] -- progressive disclosure, description quality, findability
- [[processing-workflows]] -- extraction, connection, reweaving, verification pipelines
- [[note-design]] -- atomicity, prose-as-title, composability, the generation effect
- [[maintenance-patterns]] -- condition-based maintenance, health checks, reweaving
- [[design-dimensions]] -- the 8 configuration axes and their interaction constraints

## Guidance Areas

- [[derivation-engine]] -- how the init wizard derives configurations from conversation
- [[schema-enforcement]] -- templates, validation, field evolution
- [[vocabulary-transformation]] -- 6-level domain-native vocabulary mapping
- [[failure-modes]] -- the 10 failure modes and domain vulnerability matrix
- [[memory-architecture]] -- three-space separation (notes, self, ops)
- [[multi-domain-composition]] -- adding and connecting multiple knowledge domains

## Domain Examples

- [[domain-compositions]] -- worked examples of derived vaults across 12 domains
