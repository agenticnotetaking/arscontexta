# multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph

Most real knowledge systems serve more than one purpose. A personal vault might track research, health, projects, and relationships simultaneously. A professional system might handle client work, internal knowledge, and training materials. The derivation process handles single-domain systems cleanly — since [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]], each domain maps to a reference model and gets its own configuration. But what happens when multiple domains coexist in one graph?

The composition principle is that isolation should happen at the template and processing layer while unity should happen at the graph layer. Each domain gets its own templates with domain-specific YAML fields, its own processing phase sequence in the work queue, and its own context-loading rules in the agent's operating file. But all notes — regardless of domain — share one graph connected by wiki links. A therapy reflection and a project decision and a research claim all exist in the same wiki link namespace, all traversable from any starting point. This separation works because since [[concept-orientation beats source-orientation for cross-domain connections]], extracted concept nodes can form edges across any domain boundary, and since [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]], the shared link namespace provides multi-hop traversal without requiring per-domain graph infrastructure.

Five rules make this composition tractable rather than chaotic.

First, separate templates but shared graph. Each domain defines its own note templates with fields that serve its domain semantics — a therapy domain uses `trigger`, `pattern_type`, and `coping_strategy` while a research domain uses `methodology`, `classification`, and `adapted_from`. But all notes inhabit the same `01_thinking/` flat folder (or equivalent), connected by the same wiki link mechanism. Since [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]], the domain itself becomes another facet — a classification dimension orthogonal to topic, type, and methodology. An agent querying "all notes in the therapy domain that connect to research claims" is executing a cross-facet query, which is exactly what Ranganathan's framework was designed to support.

Second, no field name conflicts. When two domains use the same term differently, prefix it: `project_status` versus `therapy_status`. This seems like mere naming convention, but it has structural consequences. YAML fields are the faceted classification dimensions that make notes queryable. A field that means different things in different domains destroys the precision that faceted access provides — `rg '^status: active'` would return a mix of active projects and active therapy sessions, conflating semantically distinct categories. Prefixing preserves queryability across the combined schema.

Third, cross-domain reflect. The connection-finding phase must search across ALL domains, not just the current one. This is where multi-domain composition creates value that single-domain systems cannot. A research insight about "cognitive load reduces decision quality" should connect to a project decision made under time pressure and a therapy reflection about stress patterns — connections that would be invisible if reflect searched only within its own domain. Since [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]], the connect phase is a structural constant that operates identically regardless of what domain produced the content. Cross-domain reflect is not an extra feature but the natural consequence of having a shared graph. This is also [[controlled disorder engineers serendipity through semantic rather than topical linking]] applied at the domain level — cross-domain reflect engineers productive unpredictability by linking semantically across domain boundaries rather than restricting connections to topical neighborhoods within a single domain.

Fourth, domain-specific processing. While the connect and verify phases work across domains, the process step is inherently domain-specific. Research content gets claim extraction. Therapy content gets pattern detection. Project content gets decision documentation. Each domain has its own phase sequence in the processing queue, its own skill implementations for the process step, and its own quality criteria. This rule exists because [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]], and multi-domain vaults are where that failure is most dangerous — without explicit domain-specific processing, the shared graph propagates one domain's operations to all domains, producing cross-domain contamination that looks like systematic design. This is where since [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]] becomes practically important — each domain might sit at a different point on the processing intensity spectrum, and the shared graph must accommodate notes of varying depth and structure without degrading navigation for any domain.

Fifth, progressive context loading. The agent's context file loads a universal base (graph mechanics, quality standards, linking philosophy) on every session, then loads domain-specific sections only when operating in that domain. A therapy processing session loads therapy templates and processing rules. A research session loads research methodology. This manages context budget — since processing intensity and schema density vary by domain, the agent needs domain-appropriate guidance without burning context on irrelevant domain rules.

What makes multi-domain composition genuinely valuable rather than merely convenient is that cross-domain connections reveal patterns invisible within any single domain. Since [[cross-links between MOC territories indicate creative leaps and integration depth]], the four cross-domain connection patterns described below are precisely the creative leaps that cross-MOC membership measures — each pattern produces notes that bridge domain-specific MOCs, and their density serves as a quality metric for whether multi-domain composition is producing genuine integration or merely cohabitation. Four connection patterns recur across multi-domain systems. Temporal correlation surfaces when entries from different domains cluster in the same time period — health problems coinciding with work stress, or creative productivity peaking during relationship stability. Entity sharing occurs when the same person, place, or concept appears in different domain contexts — a colleague who features in project decisions, research collaborations, and relationship notes becomes a hub that bridges three domain clusters. Causal chains emerge when effects in one domain trace to causes in another — sleep quality affecting cognition affecting trading performance, where each link crosses a domain boundary. Goal alignment becomes visible when activities across domains converge on the same higher-order objective — learning, practice, and networking all serving career advancement, visible only from a cross-domain vantage point.

Each of these patterns has a detection method appropriate to graph-native systems. Temporal correlation uses semantic search scoped to time periods across domains. Entity sharing uses wiki links to shared entity MOCs — since [[small-world topology requires hubs and dense local links]], these shared entities become the hubs that create short paths across domain clusters, making the multi-domain graph navigable rather than fragmented. Causal chains use semantic search for related patterns across domains. Goal alignment uses topic and area overlap analysis across domain-specific MOCs.

Multi-domain composition also raises the question of schema consistency across domain boundaries. Since [[schema enforcement via validation agents enables soft consistency]], soft enforcement becomes especially important when domains with different schemas coexist in one graph — hard enforcement that blocks on a therapy field violation would stall research processing, while soft validation that warns without blocking lets each domain maintain its own schema standards without cross-domain interference.

The shadow side is complexity management. Each new domain added to a composed system increases the cross-domain surface area quadratically — two domains have one boundary, three domains have three, five domains have ten. The connection-finding phase scales with this surface area because it must search for patterns across all domain pairs. Since [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]], dimension settings in one domain can create pressure on others — a domain with high processing intensity and dense schemas shares graph space with a domain that has light processing and minimal schemas, and the navigation depth must serve both. Whether this creates incoherence or productive tension depends on whether the shared graph mechanics (wiki links, MOCs, progressive disclosure) can bridge the gap between domains with different structural densities.

There is also the question of when multi-domain composition is preferable to separate vaults. The composition approach trades complexity for connection — you accept the overhead of cross-domain schema management, field prefixing, and multi-domain context loading in exchange for the cross-domain patterns that separate vaults would never surface. The separate-vault approach trades connection for simplicity — each vault is internally coherent but cross-vault links are impossible. Since [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]], the derivation engine should be able to reason about this trade-off: when the user's domains are loosely coupled (equipment maintenance and poetry), separate vaults are simpler with little loss. When domains are tightly coupled (health, work, and relationships for a person), the cross-domain patterns justify the composition overhead. The coupling strength between domains — how often entities, timelines, and causal chains cross boundaries — is the decision factor.

Relevant Notes:
- [[concept-orientation beats source-orientation for cross-domain connections]] — foundation: concept extraction is the prerequisite for cross-domain composition because only extracted concept nodes can participate in multi-domain graph edges
- [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]] — enables: each domain adds facets to the classification space rather than requiring separate folder hierarchies, so multi-domain membership is a facet query not a filing decision
- [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]] — constrains: adding a second domain does not simply double the configuration space because dimension interactions propagate across domain boundaries
- [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]] — simplifies: multi-domain composition inherits the universal skeleton so composition focuses on the process step divergence not the entire pipeline
- [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] — upstream: the multi-type domain problem in knowledge type classification IS the multi-domain composition problem restated at the derivation level
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — parent process: multi-domain composition is what derivation produces when the use case spans multiple knowledge types
- [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]] — context: each domain occupies its own region of the configuration space, and composition must reconcile dimension settings where they diverge
- [[small-world topology requires hubs and dense local links]] — mechanism: shared entity MOCs become the hubs that bridge domain clusters, creating the short paths that maintain graph navigability across domain boundaries
- [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]] — enables: the shared wiki link namespace is what makes multi-domain graph unity possible without infrastructure overhead
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] — explains why the field name conflict rule exists: each domain uses vocabulary native to its practitioners, so multi-domain composition must handle the prefixing and translation cost that domain-native vocabulary creates at scale
- [[cross-links between MOC territories indicate creative leaps and integration depth]] — measures: the four cross-domain connection patterns produce notes that bridge domain-specific MOCs, and cross-MOC membership density is the quality metric for whether composition creates genuine integration or mere cohabitation
- [[controlled disorder engineers serendipity through semantic rather than topical linking]] — extends: cross-domain reflect is controlled disorder applied at domain scale, engineering productive unpredictability by linking semantically across domain boundaries rather than restricting connections to within-domain topical neighborhoods
- [[schema enforcement via validation agents enables soft consistency]] — enables: multi-domain schemas with different field requirements need soft enforcement that warns without blocking, because hard enforcement across domain boundaries would cause cross-domain interference where one domain's violations stall another's processing
- [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]] — the specific danger multi-domain composition must guard against: cross-domain processing that defaults to one domain's process step for all domains propagates false universalism through the shared graph, making the fourth composition rule (domain-specific processing) the explicit remedy
- [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]] — the lifecycle applies at the composed-system level: when domains evolve at different rates, accumulated structural drift in the shared graph can require compound reseeding that restructures not just individual domain configurations but the cross-domain navigation and composition rules
