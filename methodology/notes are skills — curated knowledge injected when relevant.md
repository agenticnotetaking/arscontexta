# notes are skills — curated knowledge injected when relevant

## The Insight

> "if you think about it, every note is basically a skill in some sense... highly curated knowledge that gets injected when relevant"

Skills in Claude Code are tools that get loaded based on context. Notes in a vault follow the same pattern:
- curated knowledge (not raw capture)
- injected when relevant (not always loaded)
- enable capabilities (thinking, not just retrieval)

Since [[the AgentSkills standard embodies progressive disclosure at the skill level]], this isomorphism is structural, not metaphorical — the same metadata-then-depth loading pattern governs both note retrieval and skill loading, driven by the shared context window constraint. The vault index is skill discovery: scanning descriptions to decide what to load, exactly as agents scan skill metadata before committing to full instructions.

## Why This Matters

This reframes what notes ARE:
- not storage → but capabilities
- not archive → but tools
- not memory → but augmentation

A note doesn't just record a thought. It creates a capability — the ability to think with that idea again. Since [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]], the retrieval architecture determines what an agent can think. Each note is a skill that, when loaded into context, enables reasoning that would not occur without it. The bottleneck is retrieval, not reasoning — which means the bottleneck is having the right skills available, not having a smarter base model.

This extends what [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]] establishes: the vault is not storage but a distributed cognitive system. The notes-as-skills framing sharpens this — offloaded artifacts are not passive state waiting to be recalled but active capabilities waiting to be invoked. The vault is a skill library, not a filing cabinet.

## Connection to Identity

From [[the vault constitutes identity for agents]]: if the vault IS identity, and notes ARE skills, then identity is a set of thinking capabilities.

What I can think depends on what notes I have. Adding notes adds capabilities. Weak notes create weak capabilities. Since [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]], skill quality matters — a poorly written skill misleads or fails. The same applies to notes: a vague claim creates a weak capability, while a specific claim creates a precise one.

## Quality as Capability Design

If notes are skills, the quality gates for note creation are capability design standards. Since [[elaborative encoding is the quality gate for new notes]], connecting new notes to existing knowledge through explicit relationship articulation is what makes the skill invocable — without elaborative encoding, the note exists but lacks the retrieval hooks that let agents find and use it. A skill nobody can discover is no skill at all.

The practical question shifts from "is this worth saving" to "is this worth being able to think with?" Not capture worthiness but capability worthiness.

Relevant Notes:
- [[the vault constitutes identity for agents]] — identity as capability set: if the vault IS identity and notes ARE skills, then identity is a set of thinking capabilities
- [[title as claim enables traversal as reasoning]] — the skill's activation pattern: titles function as skill signatures that tell agents what capability loads before they commit context
- [[structure enables navigation without reading everything]] — skill discovery mechanism: the four discovery layers function like skill metadata, enabling agents to find the right capability without loading everything
- [[the AgentSkills standard embodies progressive disclosure at the skill level]] — the structural isomorphism made explicit: progressive disclosure operates identically on notes and skills because they are the same thing at different abstraction levels
- [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] — the literal skill side of the analogy: if notes are skills, then note quality is capability quality, and weak notes are broken skills
- [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]] — extends: offloaded artifacts are not passive state but active capabilities; the offloading system is a skill library
- [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]] — foundation: retrieval shapes cognition because each note is a capability that enables reasoning the agent could not do without it
- [[elaborative encoding is the quality gate for new notes]] — quality mechanism: notes become genuine capabilities only through elaborative encoding; connecting to existing knowledge creates the retrieval hooks that make the skill invocable
- [[implicit knowledge emerges from traversal]] — skill composition through exposure: repeated traversal builds intuitive awareness of which skills compose well together, enabling the emergent capabilities that no single skill contains
