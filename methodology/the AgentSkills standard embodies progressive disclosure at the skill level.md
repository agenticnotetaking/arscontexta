# the AgentSkills standard embodies progressive disclosure at the skill level

The AgentSkills standard structures skill loading in three layers: metadata (roughly 100 tokens) loads at startup for all skills so the agent knows what is available, full instructions (recommended under 5000 tokens) load when the skill is activated, and supporting resources load only when needed. This is the same progressive disclosure pattern the vault uses for knowledge content -- file tree gives awareness, descriptions give filtering, full notes give depth -- operating at the infrastructure level instead of the content level.

The structural parallel is not a coincidence. Both systems face the same fundamental constraint: context windows are finite, and what fills them determines reasoning quality. Since [[progressive disclosure means reading right not reading less]], the goal is a context window dense with relevant material, not one stuffed with everything available. At the note level, since [[structure enables navigation without reading everything]], four structural mechanisms — wiki links, MOCs, claim titles, and YAML descriptions — compose into the discovery layer stack that makes this filtering operational. At the skill level, this means metadata filters before full instructions load. The pattern recurs because the constraint recurs — and at the content level, the composition of four distinct filtering mechanisms demonstrates how progressive disclosure goes beyond a single technique to become an architectural pattern.

What makes this more than an analogy is that both layers interact within the same context window. An agent's context budget absorbs skill descriptions and note descriptions simultaneously. Since [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]], Claude Code allocates roughly 2% of context (with a 16,000-character fallback) for all skill descriptions, which means a knowledge system with many skills competes with note content for the same limited space. The progressive disclosure pattern is not merely similar across levels -- it is the same resource management strategy applied twice to the same scarce resource. And since [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]], skill metadata is information-theoretically identical to note descriptions: both are pre-computed low-entropy representations that shrink the search space before full content loads. The difference is that skill metadata operates under a platform-enforced hard budget while note descriptions face only the softer constraint of attention degradation.

Since [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]], skills carry accumulated learning in their instructions and quality gates. The progressive disclosure loading pattern ensures this accumulated learning enters context only when relevant, not constantly. A vault with twenty skills would overwhelm context if every skill's full instructions loaded at startup. The metadata layer lets the agent hold awareness of all twenty skills while only loading the full methodology for the one it needs right now.

The pattern also has a pragmatic standardization value. Since [[platform fragmentation means identical conceptual operations require different implementations across agent environments]], the AgentSkills standard reduces fragmentation at the skill metadata level by defining a common SKILL.md format that works across twenty-plus platforms. The metadata layer is standardizable precisely because it is the progressive disclosure layer -- it captures what any agent needs to know (what the skill does, when to use it) while leaving platform-specific implementation details in the full instructions that load on demand. The standard solves fragmentation where the cost of fragmentation is lowest: at the awareness layer, where agents need to know what skills exist, not how they work internally.

The complementary infrastructure story connects to how [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]]. Hooks save context by running validation outside the context window entirely. Skill progressive disclosure saves context by deferring full instructions until needed. Together, these mechanisms form the complete context management strategy at the infrastructure level: hooks handle what can run externally, progressive disclosure handles what must enter context but can enter on demand rather than at startup.

The deeper implication is architectural: any system that operates under context window constraints will converge on progressive disclosure patterns at every level of its stack. But convergence requires the platform to support the pattern. Since [[platform capability tiers determine which knowledge system features can be implemented]], the AgentSkills standard's progressive disclosure only functions at tier one and tier two, where skill infrastructure exists. At tier three, there are no skills to disclose progressively — the methodology lives entirely in instruction-level context files, and the metadata-then-depth loading pattern collapses to a single layer. The standard standardizes an inherently tier-dependent feature, which means its portability value is bounded by the tier distribution of actual agent platforms. Since [[intermediate packets enable assembly over creation]], skill metadata functions as a packet specification -- it tells the orchestrator what the skill does and when to invoke it, enabling workflow assembly from modular skills rather than monolithic execution. The metadata-then-instructions pattern is literally a packet structure: compressed awareness enabling informed assembly decisions. The question is not whether to use progressive disclosure but at which levels it has been implemented and at which levels it is still missing.

Relevant Notes:
- [[progressive disclosure means reading right not reading less]] -- foundation: the vault philosophy that this claim extends to infrastructure
- [[structure enables navigation without reading everything]] -- content-level counterpart: composes wiki links, MOCs, claim titles, and descriptions into the discovery layer stack that demonstrates progressive disclosure as an architectural pattern, not just a single technique
- [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] -- establishes that skills carry accumulated learning, making their loading pattern consequential
- [[descriptions are retrieval filters not summaries]] -- the note-level instance of the same pattern: descriptions enable filtering before full content loading
- [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]] -- develops the hard budget constraint (2% / 16k chars) that makes this progressive disclosure pattern not optional but mandatory
- [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]] -- provides the information-theoretic formalization: skill metadata is entropy-reducing pre-computation, the same mechanism that justifies note descriptions
- [[platform fragmentation means identical conceptual operations require different implementations across agent environments]] -- the AgentSkills standard partially solves fragmentation by standardizing the metadata layer while leaving platform-specific capabilities outside scope
- [[hooks enable context window efficiency by delegating deterministic checks to external processes]] -- complementary context efficiency mechanism: hooks save context by running outside the window, progressive disclosure saves context by loading on demand; together they form the complete infrastructure-level context management story
- [[intermediate packets enable assembly over creation]] -- skill metadata functions as a packet specification: it tells the orchestrator what the skill does and when to invoke it, enabling workflow assembly from modular skills
- [[platform capability tiers determine which knowledge system features can be implemented]] -- the progressive disclosure pattern at the skill level only operates at tier one and two; tier-three platforms lack skill infrastructure entirely, collapsing the metadata-then-depth pattern to a single instruction layer
