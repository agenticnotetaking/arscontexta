# incremental formalization happens through repeated touching of old notes

Rigorous concepts rarely emerge fully formed. A note that begins as a vague inkling — "something about how maintenance affects quality" — sharpens over months into a precise claim through repeated encounters. Each time you link to the note, you re-evaluate it against current understanding. Each time you traverse through it, you notice what could be clearer. The crystallization happens not through deliberate revision sessions but through the accumulation of small touchpoints.

This pattern has theoretical grounding in how spaced repetition creates durable memory. When linking a new note to old ones, you force brief retrieval and re-evaluation of those old notes. The act of deciding "does this connect?" requires accessing what the old note claims, which approximates the retrieval practice that strengthens memory. But unlike pure memorization, each retrieval also creates an opportunity for incremental improvement — you might sharpen a phrase, add a missing connection, or clarify an ambiguous claim. Because [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]], even these micro-improvements create cognitive hooks that pure reading would not. And since [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]], the formalization isn't just improving the note itself — it's enhancing every path that traverses through it, making the improved node more valuable to the entire network. The compounding operates through a second mechanism too: since [[MOC maintenance investment compounds because orientation savings multiply across every future session]], each micro-improvement to a context phrase or description saves orientation time in every subsequent session that loads the note, and hub-level notes that load frequently have the highest temporal multiplier on those savings.

The incremental nature distinguishes this from [[backward maintenance asks what would be different if written today]]. Reweaving asks one holistic question: "if I wrote this today, what would be different?" That produces a single comprehensive reconsideration. Incremental formalization works differently — it accumulates many small touches over time rather than a few deep passes. Both mechanisms improve notes, but through different rhythms. Reweaving might transform a note in one session; incremental formalization might touch the same note twenty times across six months, each time making it slightly better. Since [[three concurrent maintenance loops operate at different timescales to catch different classes of problems]], these two rhythms map onto different loops: incremental formalization's organic touches happen within the medium loop — the per-session encounters where an agent traverses through a note and makes a small improvement — while dedicated reweaving happens in the slow loop as a high-judgment operation requiring its own session. The architecture clarifies that these are not competing approaches but complementary operations running at different timescales. If [[maturity field enables agent context prioritization]], the transition from seedling to developing to evergreen could track cumulative formalization — a note becomes evergreen not through one deep pass but through accumulating enough small touches that its claims have been pressure-tested from many angles.

The practical implication for agent maintenance is that traversal should be bidirectional. When agents run reflect to connect new notes to old ones, the process should not just add forward links. It should also touch the old notes — adding the reciprocal link, yes, but also taking the opportunity to make small improvements. If [[spaced repetition scheduling could optimize vault maintenance]], the scheduling should account for both kinds of attention: dedicated reweaving sessions that ask the holistic question, and the organic touches that happen whenever a note appears in another note's context. Since [[mnemonic medium embeds verification into navigation]], these organic touches might happen naturally during traversal — each time an agent follows a link and evaluates whether the relationship holds, it creates an opportunity to notice and fix small issues. Verification and formalization become the same action.

Low-link-count notes deserve explicit attention here. A note with few incoming links gets touched less frequently, which means fewer crystallization opportunities. Periodic "crystallization passes" where agents revisit low-link notes and attempt to connect them serve double duty: finding missed connections and providing the touch that enables incremental improvement. Since [[random note resurfacing prevents write-only memory]], random selection already provides some crystallization opportunities, but targeting low-link notes might accelerate formalization for the notes that need it most.

The deeper point is that the medium permits this. Since [[digital mutability enables note evolution that physical permanence forbids]], analog cards could not accumulate small improvements — each change would degrade the card, requiring rewriting or creating parallel versions. Digital files absorb unlimited micro-improvements invisibly. The accumulation pattern that incremental formalization depends on is a property of the substrate, not just a workflow choice. And since [[stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication]], each micro-improvement is a stigmergic trace: the sharpened description, the added link, the clarified phrase all modify the environment in ways that guide future agents toward richer engagement with the same note. No agent coordinates with any previous agent about what to improve — each responds to the current state of the note and leaves it slightly better for the next.

There is a specific cost that incremental formalization creates. As notes crystallize through accumulated touches, their titles often sharpen — a vague `knowledge management friction` becomes the precise `curation becomes the work when creation is easy`. But since [[tag rot applies to wiki links because titles serve as both identifier and display text]], every title sharpening triggers a rename cascade proportional to incoming link count. The irony is that the most formalized notes — the ones that accumulated the most touches and therefore the most incoming links — are the most expensive to rename. Crystallization and rename cost grow together.

There is also a limit to what incremental formalization can accomplish on its own. Since [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]], accumulated incremental changes — at both the note level and the system level — can produce systemic incoherence where the configuration has drifted into a region where individual improvements are locally justified but globally contradictory. Incremental formalization operates within the evolution phase, but when the accumulated micro-adaptations produce friction that no further micro-adaptation can resolve, the system needs reseeding: principled restructuring that re-derives the framework while preserving the content. This is not a failure of incremental formalization but a boundary condition — the mechanism works beautifully within a coherent framework and cannot fix the framework itself.

There is a different kind of boundary too: some knowledge resists formalization entirely. Since [[operational wisdom requires contextual observation]], tacit understanding of how a community talks, what gets engagement, or how a specific person prefers to communicate cannot crystallize into claim notes no matter how many times you touch them. These observations accumulate as dated logs rather than sharpening into atomic claims. Incremental formalization assumes the destination is a precise claim — but operational wisdom's destination is a pattern-matched intuition built from many specific observations. The observation log is not a proto-claim waiting for enough touches to crystallize; it is a different kind of knowledge artifact that accumulates rather than sharpens. Navigation heuristics are a third kind: since [[agent notes externalize navigation intuition that search cannot discover and traversal cannot reconstruct]], the structural insights that emerge during traversal — where to start, which notes combine productively, which paths are dead ends — resist both claim-level formalization (they are about the graph's structure, not its content) and observation-level logging (they are durable across sessions, not context-specific moments). Agent notes in MOCs are the formalization destination for this knowledge type, and the repeated touchpoints of incremental formalization are precisely what generate the navigation insights they capture.

There is a third rhythm beyond organic touches and dedicated reweaving: deliberate reflection sessions. Since [[reflection synthesizes existing notes into new insight]], inward-facing sessions that read existing notes rather than process new input produce emergent synthesis through cross-note pattern recognition. Where organic formalization makes small improvements during routine traversal and reweaving asks the holistic "what would be different" question, reflection sessions deliberately re-traverse clusters of related notes looking for patterns that connect them. The synthesis that emerges is itself a formalization — making implicit cross-note patterns explicit as a new claim — and the backward reweaving that follows updates the original notes, creating another round of incremental improvement.

Whether incremental formalization produces better outcomes than concentrated reweaving is an empirical question. The hypothesis is that many small touches produce a different kind of quality than few deep passes — perhaps catching issues that only become visible from particular angles, or producing prose that reflects many revisits rather than one reconsideration. The test is whether notes that receive frequent light touches outperform notes that receive infrequent deep reweavings on measures like clarity, connection density, and retrieval success. Since [[continuous small-batch processing eliminates review dread]], the rhythm of continuous processing naturally creates these touchpoints — each processing session that encounters an old note is a formalization opportunity, making incremental improvement a side effect of normal operation rather than a deliberate maintenance phase.

The convergence thesis in capture design provides a concrete example of incremental formalization at scale. Since [[three capture schools converge through agent-mediated synthesis]], the Interpretationist ideal of fully processed notes is achieved not at capture time but through accumulated agent touches — the initial processing pass extracts and describes, subsequent reflect and reweave passes deepen connections, and organic encounters during future traversals continue refining. This is incremental formalization operating as the mechanism by which fast capture eventually reaches Interpretationist quality: not through one-shot human interpretation, but through accumulated agent passes that each contribute a small formalization step.
