# note-design

How to design individual notes for maximum composability and retrieval quality. Atomicity, prose-as-title, the generation effect, description quality standards.

## Core Ideas

### Research
- [[claims must be specific enough to be wrong]] -- Vague claims can't be disagreed with or built on — for agents, vague titles are undocumented functions where you can inv
- [[coherent architecture emerges from wiki links spreading activation and small-world topology]] -- The foundational triangle — wiki links create structure, spreading activation models traversal, small-world topology pro
- [[decontextualization risk means atomicity may strip meaning that cannot be recovered]] -- Extracting claims from source discourse strips argumentative context, and Source footers plus wiki links may not reconst
- [[each module must be describable in one sentence under 200 characters or it does too many things]] -- The single-sentence test operationalizes Unix "do one thing" as a measurable constraint — if the description exceeds 200
- [[elaborative encoding is the quality gate for new notes]] -- Zettelkasten works because connecting new information to existing knowledge — not just filing it — creates encoding dept
- [[enforcing atomicity can create paralysis when ideas resist decomposition]] -- The cognitive effort of splitting complex arguments into single-concept notes can exceed productive friction, becoming s
- [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]] -- retrieval architecture shapes what enters the context window and therefore what the agent thinks — memory structure has 
- [[forced engagement produces weak connections]] -- Waiting for natural fits where you have genuine substance to contribute builds better connections than engaging for acti
- [[guided notes might outperform post-hoc structuring for high-volume capture]] -- Research suggests skeleton outlines provided before capture reduce cognitive load more than structuring afterward, chall
- [[logic column pattern separates reasoning from procedure]] -- Dual-column structure where right side shows steps and left side shows the principle or rule applied at each step — agen
- [[narrow folksonomy optimizes for single-operator retrieval unlike broad consensus tagging]] -- Thomas Vander Wal's broad/narrow distinction explains why vault tagging uses idiosyncratic sentence-titles instead of co
- [[note titles should function as APIs enabling sentence transclusion]] -- Declarative titles transclude directly into prose, letting agents compose arguments from title-claims without loading fu
- [[notes are skills — curated knowledge injected when relevant]] -- notes and skills follow the same pattern — highly curated knowledge that gets injected into context when relevant, refra
- [[progressive schema validates only what active modules require not the full system schema]] -- Each module declares its required YAML fields and validation checks only active modules — otherwise disabling modules do
- [[provenance tracks where beliefs come from]] -- agents should track not just what they believe but where beliefs originated — observed, prompted, or inherited — to cali
- [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]] -- Five signals (manual additions, placeholder stuffing, dead enums, patterned text, oversized MOCs) drive a quarterly prot
- [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]] -- The five-component note architecture (prose-title, YAML frontmatter, body, wiki links, topics footer) is domain-invarian
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] -- When schema field names match how practitioners naturally think — "triggers" not "antecedent_conditions" — adoption succ
- [[source attribution enables tracing claims to foundations]] -- Distinguishes original thinking from consumed ideas, creating a verification graph where any claim can follow its eviden
- [[structure without processing provides no value]] -- The "Lazy Cornell" anti-pattern shows that drawing lines without doing the work produces no benefit over linear notes — 
- [[summary coherence tests composability before filing]] -- If a note cannot be summarized in 1-3 coherent sentences, it bundles multiple claims that should be split before leaving
- [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]] -- Moving files between folders or tagging content is not processing — agents must synthesize descriptions, connections, or
- [[the system is the argument]] -- Philosophy with proof of work — for agents, this is verifiable constraint: the system cannot claim what it does not prac
- [[the vault constitutes identity for agents]] -- humans augment persistent identity with vaults; agents constitute identity through vaults because weights are shared but
- [[title as claim enables traversal as reasoning]] -- when note titles are complete claims rather than topics, traversing wiki links reads like prose and following paths beco
- [[vault conventions may impose hidden rigidity on thinking]] -- Accumulated vault conventions may channel thinking into patterns that favor certain styles over others, despite the flat
- [[writing for audience blocks authentic creation]] -- Awareness of readers invades the thinking space, adding polish and context that serves presentation rather than understa
- [[you operate a system that takes notes]] -- the shift from note-taking to system operation reframes the human role from creator to curator — judgment over mechanics

### Guidance
- [[design MOCs as attention management devices with lifecycle governance]] -- MOC best practices for derived knowledge systems — hierarchy patterns, lifecycle management, and health metrics adapted 

## Tensions

(Capture conflicts as they emerge)

## Open Questions

- Where is the boundary between too atomic and not atomic enough?
- How does the generation effect apply to agent-authored notes?
