# temporal media must convert to spatial text for agent traversal

Agents can read a document at any point — jump to paragraph seven, scan a heading, grep for a phrase. They cannot do this with video or audio. A podcast is a time-locked sequence: to reach minute forty-two, you must either know the timestamp in advance or scan linearly. An agent traversing a knowledge graph needs random access to content, and temporal media does not provide random access. The conversion from temporal to spatial is therefore not optional but architecturally necessary.

This is a constraint that emerges from what agents fundamentally are. Since [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]], knowledge graph traversal works through jumping between connected nodes, following wiki links, loading context from descriptions before deciding whether to read full notes. None of these operations have temporal media equivalents. You cannot wiki-link into minute fourteen of a podcast. You cannot grep an audio file for a concept. You cannot scan the "headings" of a video to decide which section to load. Since [[progressive disclosure means reading right not reading less]], the entire discovery layer architecture — titles through descriptions through outlines through full content — assumes spatial, randomly accessible text. Progressive disclosure cannot function on temporal media because there is no way to "scan headings" or "read the description first" when content is locked inside a time stream.

The practical implication is that every temporal source — podcasts, video lectures, voice memos, meeting recordings — must produce a primary markdown artifact as its first processing step. Since [[voice capture is the highest-bandwidth channel for agent-delegated knowledge systems]], voice capture is the highest-bandwidth temporal channel, producing dumps at 150 wpm that then require exactly this conversion. The transcript-first principle applies: the transcript becomes the working artifact, and the original recording becomes a backup for deeper engagement. Whisper-style transcription produces the raw text. Agent processing structures it with headings, timestamps, and wiki links. But these two steps are qualitatively different: because [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]], transcription is merely format conversion — the raw text is the same content in a different container. The generative transformation happens when the agent adds headings, wiki links, and extracts claims. Transcription makes traversal possible; agent processing makes it valuable. The result enters the vault as a standard markdown file that participates in the knowledge graph like any other note.

The conversion is lossy. Audio carries tone, emphasis, hesitation, emotional texture that flat text discards. Video carries spatial relationships, gestures, visual demonstrations. These losses are real but acceptable because the alternative — leaving content in temporal format — means agents cannot traverse it at all. A lossy transcript that agents can search, link, and synthesize outperforms a perfect recording that sits inert in the filesystem. Since [[local-first file formats are inherently agent-native]], the markdown transcript inherits all the properties that make the vault work: any LLM can read it, wiki links create graph edges, YAML frontmatter enables filtering. The original recording lacks every one of these properties.

The relationship to temporal versus topological organization is instructive. Since [[topological organization beats temporal for knowledge work]], the vault already commits to organizing by concept rather than by date. This note extends the same principle to media format: just as chronological filing buries knowledge under temporal sediment, temporal media buries knowledge inside time-locked sequences. The garden metaphor applies at the format level, not just the organizational level. Text is the garden. Audio and video are the stream. This is why [[ThreadMode to DocumentMode transformation is the core value creation step]] applies at the format level, not just the content level: temporal media is inherently ThreadMode — it accretes sequentially, carries the speaker's chronological context, and resists reorganization. The markdown artifact that emerges from conversion is DocumentMode — timeless, randomly accessible, composable with the rest of the knowledge graph. And since [[three capture schools converge through agent-mediated synthesis]], the temporal-to-spatial conversion is the first step in the convergence pipeline — voice capture at Accumulationist speed, transcription as the format bridge, agent processing with Interpretationist quality.

There is a two-layer graph that emerges from this conversion. The primary layer is the wiki link graph connecting markdown notes. The secondary layer consists of timestamp links that point back into the original temporal source — `youtube.com/watch?v=ID&t=50s` or `recording.mp3#t=14:32`. These timestamp anchors let a human (or a future multimodal agent) dive back into the original medium for the nuance that transcription lost. The two layers serve different functions: the wiki link layer enables agent traversal, the timestamp layer preserves source fidelity for human review.

This also explains why since [[capture the reaction to content not just the content itself]], the human's role during temporal capture shifts. Rather than transcribing in real-time (which voice capture handles), the human marks moments of interest — a tap to capture the last sixty seconds, a verbal annotation that flags significance. These sparse human signals become enrichment metadata that guide the agent's later processing. The human provides judgment about what matters; the agent provides the format conversion and structural integration.

The claim is closed because it follows directly from the agent substrate constraint. If your knowledge system operates on text files with wiki links, then content that is not text files with wiki links must become text files with wiki links before it can participate. The only question is how good the conversion can be, not whether it should happen.

Relevant Notes:
- [[local-first file formats are inherently agent-native]] — the target format: markdown with YAML and wiki links is what temporal media must become to enter the agent-readable substrate
- [[topological organization beats temporal for knowledge work]] — parallel principle: just as chronological filing loses to topological filing, chronological media loses to spatial text for knowledge traversal
- [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]] — the traversal mechanism that temporal media cannot support: spreading activation requires jumping between nodes, which demands random access
- [[three capture schools converge through agent-mediated synthesis]] — the pipeline this conversion enables: once temporal content becomes text, agent-mediated synthesis can apply Interpretationist quality to Accumulationist speed capture
- [[capture the reaction to content not just the content itself]] — the human role during temporal capture: marking moments of interest and recording reactions while the agent handles conversion
- [[dual-coding with visual elements could enhance agent traversal]] — the reverse direction: this note argues temporal must become spatial, dual-coding explores whether spatial-visual could complement spatial-textual
- [[voice capture is the highest-bandwidth channel for agent-delegated knowledge systems]] — upstream source: voice capture is the highest-bandwidth temporal capture channel, producing the very media this note says must convert; the emotional metadata voice preserves is exactly what transcription loses
- [[ThreadMode to DocumentMode transformation is the core value creation step]] — parallel pattern: temporal-to-spatial conversion is ThreadMode-to-DocumentMode applied at the format level; temporal media is inherently ThreadMode (chronological, sequential), and the markdown output is DocumentMode (timeless, randomly accessible)
- [[progressive disclosure means reading right not reading less]] — architectural dependency: the entire discovery layer architecture that progressive disclosure depends on assumes spatial, randomly accessible text; this note explains why that assumption is non-negotiable
- [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]] — distinguishes two steps: transcription is format conversion (non-generative), while the agent structuring that follows (adding headings, wiki links, extracting claims) is the generative transformation that creates vault value
