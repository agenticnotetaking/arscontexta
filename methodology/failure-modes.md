# failure-modes

The 10 documented failure modes for knowledge systems. Domain vulnerability matrix mapping which failures are most likely in which contexts. Detection and mitigation strategies.

## Core Ideas

### Guidance
- [[prevent domain-specific failure modes through the vulnerability matrix]] -- Domain-specific failure modes and prevention strategies — what breaks in knowledge systems across domains, why it breaks

## Tensions

(Capture conflicts as they emerge)

## Open Questions

- Are there undocumented failure modes emerging from agent-operated systems?
- How do failure modes interact with each other?
