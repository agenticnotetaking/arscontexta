# graph-structure

How knowledge vaults function as queryable graph databases. Nodes are markdown files, edges are wiki links, properties are YAML frontmatter.

## Core Ideas

### Research
- [[IBIS framework maps claim-based architecture to structured argumentation]] -- Rittel's Issue-Position-Argument structure (1970) maps directly onto vault architecture — claim-titled notes are Positio
- [[MOC construction forces synthesis that automated generation from metadata cannot replicate]] -- The Dump-Lump-Jump pattern reveals that writing context phrases and identifying tensions IS the thinking — automated top
- [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]] -- MOCs preserve the arrangement of ideas that would otherwise need mental reconstruction, reducing the 23-minute context s
- [[agent notes externalize navigation intuition that search cannot discover and traversal cannot reconstruct]] -- Navigation intuition — traversal order, productive note combinations, dead ends — is structural knowledge that humans re
- [[associative ontologies beat hierarchical taxonomies because heterarchy adapts while hierarchy brittles]] -- Hierarchies require predicting where information belongs before understanding, and items often belong in many places — a
- [[backlinks implicitly define notes by revealing usage context]] -- A note's meaning includes not just its content but its network position — what links TO it reveals the contexts where th
- [[basic level categorization determines optimal MOC granularity]] -- Rosch's prototype theory predicts MOC titles work best at the "chair" level — specific enough to be informative, general
- [[betweenness centrality identifies bridge notes connecting disparate knowledge domains]] -- Graph theory metric that quantifies how often a note lies on shortest paths between others, revealing structural bridges
- [[coherent architecture emerges from wiki links spreading activation and small-world topology]] -- The foundational triangle — wiki links create structure, spreading activation models traversal, small-world topology pro
- [[community detection algorithms can inform when MOCs should split or merge]] -- Louvain and similar algorithms detect dense note clusters and track how cluster boundaries shift over time, providing ac
- [[complete navigation requires four complementary types that no single mechanism provides]] -- Rosenfeld and Morville's global, local, contextual, and supplemental navigation types map onto hub, MOC, wiki link, and 
- [[concept-orientation beats source-orientation for cross-domain connections]] -- Notes organized by source bundle ideas by origin not meaning, preventing the same concept from different authors from me
- [[context phrase clarity determines how deep a navigation hierarchy can scale]] -- Larson & Czerwinski (1998) found deeper hierarchies outperform flat ones only when labels enable confident branch commit
- [[controlled disorder engineers serendipity through semantic rather than topical linking]] -- Luhmann's information theory insight — perfectly ordered systems yield zero surprise, so linking by meaning rather than 
- [[cross-links between MOC territories indicate creative leaps and integration depth]] -- Notes that appear in multiple distant MOCs are integration points where ideas from separate domains combine — tracking c
- [[dangling links reveal which notes want to exist]] -- Wiki links to non-existent notes accumulate as organic signals of concept demand, and frequency analysis identifies whic
- [[data exit velocity measures how quickly content escapes vendor lock-in]] -- Three-tier framework (high/medium/low velocity) turns abstract portability into an auditable metric where every feature 
- [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]] -- Unlike folders where 1000 documents is just 1000 documents, a graph of 1000 connected nodes creates millions of potentia
- [[elaborative encoding is the quality gate for new notes]] -- Zettelkasten works because connecting new information to existing knowledge — not just filing it — creates encoding dept
- [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]] -- Ranganathan's 1933 PMEST framework formalizes why each YAML field should be an independent classification dimension — fa
- [[federated wiki pattern enables multi-agent divergence as feature not bug]] -- Cunningham's federation applied to agent knowledge work -- linked parallel notes preserve interpretive diversity, with b
- [[implicit knowledge emerges from traversal]] -- path exposure through wiki links trains intuitive navigation patterns that bypass explicit retrieval — the vault structu
- [[inline links carry richer relationship data than metadata fields]] -- The prose surrounding a wiki link captures WHY two notes connect, not just THAT they connect — relationship context that
- [[markdown plus YAML plus ripgrep implements a queryable graph database without infrastructure]] -- Wiki link edges, YAML metadata, faceted query dimensions, and soft validation compose into graph database capabilities w
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] -- Domain isolation at template and processing layers, graph unity at wiki link layer — five composition rules and four cro
- [[navigation infrastructure passes through distinct scaling regimes that require qualitative strategy shifts]] -- At 50 notes keyword search suffices, at 500 curated MOCs become essential, at 5000 automated maintenance replaces manual
- [[navigational vertigo emerges in pure association systems without local hierarchy]] -- Pure link-based navigation makes unlinked neighbors unreachable — MOCs provide temporary local hierarchies that compleme
- [[propositional link semantics transform wiki links from associative to reasoned]] -- Standardizing a vocabulary of relationship types (causes, enables, contradicts, extends) makes wiki link connections mac
- [[role field makes graph structure explicit]] -- A role field distinguishing moc/hub/leaf/synthesis would let agents make smarter traversal decisions without inferring s
- [[small-world topology requires hubs and dense local links]] -- Network science shows knowledge graphs need power-law distributions where MOCs have many links and atomic notes have few
- [[stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication]] -- Termites build nests by responding to structure not each other, and agent swarms work the same way — wiki links, MOCs, a
- [[structure enables navigation without reading everything]] -- Four structural mechanisms — wiki links, MOCs, claim titles, and YAML descriptions — compose into discovery layers that 
- [[tag rot applies to wiki links because titles serve as both identifier and display text]] -- Unlike opaque identifiers that persist through vocabulary drift, wiki link titles carry semantic content that must stay 
- [[title as claim enables traversal as reasoning]] -- when note titles are complete claims rather than topics, traversing wiki links reads like prose and following paths beco
- [[topological organization beats temporal for knowledge work]] -- The garden vs stream distinction from digital gardening theory grounds why vaults use topic MOCs and wiki links rather t
- [[wiki links are the digital evolution of analog indexing]] -- Cornell's 1940s cue column functioned as an index pointing to content blocks, making wiki link graphs the digital fulfil
- [[wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references]] -- Cunningham's norm that creating a link means accepting elaboration responsibility translates from human peer accountabil
- [[wiki links create navigation paths that shape retrieval]] -- wiki links are curated graph edges that implement GraphRAG-style retrieval without infrastructure — each link is a retri
- [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]] -- Explicit wiki links create a human-curated knowledge graph that enables multi-hop reasoning without entity extraction pi

## Tensions

(Capture conflicts as they emerge)

## Open Questions

- What graph metrics predict vault health most reliably?
- How does link density interact with retrieval quality?
