# session outputs are packets for future selves

Connection discovered while reading [[intermediate packets enable assembly over creation]] alongside the Memento metaphor.

## The Insight

Each session should produce composable building blocks — not just notes, but packets that future sessions can assemble from without starting over.

The Memento tattoos aren't just memory storage. They're assembly instructions. "Remember Sammy Jankis" isn't data — it's a callable function that triggers a whole reasoning chain. Since [[note titles should function as APIs enabling sentence transclusion]], the same pattern operates in the vault: each title is a function signature the next session can call, and the body is the implementation you load only when you need the details.

## What This Means for Agent Sessions

Session handoffs are packets. The commit message summarizes what happened, the task list shows what's pending, the inbox captures show raw discoveries. Together they form a briefing for session N+1. Since [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]], these packets are what make multi-session coherence possible despite the agent's lack of persistent memory. And because [[stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication]], these packets function as pheromone traces — one session modifies the environment (writes task files, advances queue entries, adds wiki links) and the next session responds to those modifications rather than receiving a message.

Memory notes function as callable abstractions. A title like "curation becomes the work when creation is easy" invokes a whole reasoning chain without needing to load the full note. Each title is a function signature the next session can call, and the note body is available when the argument needs grounding.

The test: can a fresh session assemble useful work from what I left behind? Or does every session start from scratch?

## The Quality Question

Am I creating genuine building blocks, or just organized content that looks composable but requires re-understanding each time? Since [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]], packets must contain generated artifacts — synthesis, articulated connections, processed insights — not merely collected inputs. A session that produces only file reorganization has zero assembly value for the next session. The generation is what makes the packet composable. But since [[closure rituals create clean breaks that prevent attention residue bleed]], the packet must also signal what is definitively done so that the next session doesn't waste attention reconstructing completed context. Packets and closure are complementary session-boundary mechanisms: packets preserve continuity, closure prevents residue.

Relevant Notes:
- [[intermediate packets enable assembly over creation]] — foundation: the source insight that work products should be composable building blocks, not monolithic outputs
- [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]] — enables: handoff documents ARE packets; they bridge session isolation through structured briefings
- [[note titles should function as APIs enabling sentence transclusion]] — extends: titles as callable function signatures is the same pattern applied to individual notes; session packets are the session-level instance of the notes-as-APIs design
- [[stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication]] — foundation: session packets are stigmergic traces; one session modifies the environment and the next responds to those modifications without direct communication
- [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]] — tests: the question section asks whether packets contain genuine building blocks or reorganized content; generation determines whether outputs enable assembly or merely look composable
- [[closure rituals create clean breaks that prevent attention residue bleed]] — complements: closure marks what ends, packets preserve what continues; both are needed at session boundaries to manage the full attention lifecycle
- [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]] — grounds: session packets are the incremental units through which memory architecture gets constructed; each packet adds to the retrieval landscape that shapes future cognition, making session output quality a direct investment in memory architecture
