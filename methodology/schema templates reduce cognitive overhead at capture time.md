# schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time

When you face a blank page, you must make two kinds of decisions: what to capture and how to structure it. A schema template eliminates the second decision entirely. Instead of designing a note's structure while simultaneously trying to record content, you fill in pre-defined fields. The cognitive work shifts from "what should I record about this?" to "what goes in this box?"

This is why tools like Tana's supertags work. A supertag is a schema attached to a note type — when you create a "book" note, the template pre-populates fields: author, year, key arguments, personal takeaways. You don't decide whether to record the author; the field exists, so you fill it. The schema externalizes the structural decision, offloading working memory during the capture moment. Because [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]], every friction point in capture fights against the cognitive architecture — and schema templates reduce that friction by handling structure mechanically so the human's limited working memory stays focused on content.

For agent-operated vaults, this matters because capture happens at the boundary between human and system. The human has context that will decay. Since [[temporal separation of capture and processing preserves context freshness]], there's urgency to capture before understanding fades. But if capture requires structural decisions, the human burns cognitive resources on formatting instead of content. Schema templates preserve context-capture bandwidth by handling structure mechanically.

This is the opposite of the Lazy Cornell anti-pattern. Since [[structure without processing provides no value]], merely having structure (drawing the lines) produces no benefit without the processing (filling the boxes thoughtfully). Schema templates work because they guide processing: each field prompts a specific generative act. The schema externalizes structure so attention can focus on generation within the structure. This is why since [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]], schema-guided capture can still produce encoding benefits — filling in "key arguments" forces you to identify them, which is generative work.

The design principle: at capture time, minimize decisions about form so attention can focus on substance. The schema is not a constraint but a scaffold — it guides what to notice and record without requiring real-time architectural thinking. But structural scaffolding alone is not sufficient. Because [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]], the template's field choices carry the entire burden of domain adaptation — the rest of the note format (title, body, links, topics) works identically across domains. This concentration means since [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]], field names must match how the practitioner naturally thinks. A template that says "triggers" reduces overhead completely for a therapist; a template that says "antecedent_conditions" reduces structural overhead while introducing linguistic overhead, partially negating the benefit.

There's a tradeoff embedded here. Schema templates add ceremony -- you must fill in fields even when they feel irrelevant. Since [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]], each template field represents an independent classification dimension, and independence means each must be populated separately. More facets means more ceremony. But the claim is that this friction costs less than the cognitive overhead of unstructured capture, because the friction is mechanical (fill boxes) while the overhead is creative (design structure). Mechanical work is less draining than design work when context is fading. But since [[vault conventions may impose hidden rigidity on thinking]], schema templates carry a risk: if the schema doesn't fit the content, the template becomes a constraint that channels thinking into pre-determined patterns rather than scaffolding that supports it. The test is whether forced reformulation into schema fields produces clarity or distortion.

This connects to metadata's retrieval function. Since [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]], the fields you fill at capture time directly enable precision retrieval later. Since [[retrieval utility should drive design over capture completeness]], the schema template is retrieval-first design: the fields you capture ARE the fields you'll query. A schema template is the capture-side of what descriptions and type fields provide at retrieval-time: pre-computed structure that makes the system queryable. But the schema template insight is specifically about cognitive economics at the capture moment — not just what metadata enables later, but how schema reduces the mental cost of creating that metadata in the first place.

The agent implication: when designing capture interfaces (whether for human input or agent extraction), provide structure upfront rather than requiring the capturer to invent it. For source extraction, this means templates with fields like source, date, key claims, quotes, and synthesis hooks. The reducer doesn't decide what to extract about a source — the template specifies it. This is why the vault's task files have standardized sections: since [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]], the schema IS the methodology — it tells the agent what to extract and in what form. The structure is given, so processing becomes execution.

The layering formula for descriptions exemplifies this principle in miniature. Since [[good descriptions layer heuristic then mechanism then implication]], descriptions have a schema: lead with actionable, back with mechanism, end with implication. This is a template that reduces cognitive overhead for description-writing — instead of designing each description from scratch, you fill in three layers.

There's an interesting distinction between schema templates and guided notes. Since [[guided notes might outperform post-hoc structuring for high-volume capture]], research suggests skeleton outlines work particularly well for streaming content — lectures, meetings, conversations — where information arrives faster than you can fully process. Schema templates fit discrete content (a book, an article) where you know the content type and can fill fields after reading. Guided notes fit flows where you're capturing in real-time and need structure that guides attention without requiring design decisions. Both externalize structure to reduce cognitive load, but schema templates specify WHAT fields to record while guided notes specify HOW to organize incoming flow (main ideas vs. supporting details vs. questions).

Relevant Notes:
- [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]] — the theoretical foundation; Risko and Gilbert's offloading economics explain WHY reducing capture friction matters: if offloading costs more effort than retaining, the human retains and the system loses the thought
- [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]] — the retrieval side of what schemas enable at capture time; schema templates ensure the metadata gets created
- [[temporal separation of capture and processing preserves context freshness]] — creates urgency that schemas address: reduce capture-time decisions so content gets recorded while context is fresh
- [[does agent processing recover what fast capture loses]] — schema-driven capture occupies a middle ground: more structure than pure dumps (preserving some generation benefit for the human), less cognitive load than fully designed notes (enabling faster capture)
- [[vault conventions may impose hidden rigidity on thinking]] — the shadow side: if the schema doesn't fit the content, templates become constraints that channel thinking rather than scaffolds that support it
- [[WIP limits force processing over accumulation]] — sibling forcing function: schema templates force structure at capture, WIP limits force processing before capture; both shape behavior through architectural constraints rather than soft guidelines
- [[continuous small-batch processing eliminates review dread]] — complementary intervention: schema templates reduce capture-time overhead, small-batch processing reduces review-time dread; both target psychological friction that causes abandonment
- [[the generation effect requires active transformation not just storage]] — schema templates guide generation: each field prompts a specific generative act, so filling boxes IS transformation
- [[structure without processing provides no value]] — schema templates are the opposite of Lazy Cornell: they guide processing by specifying WHAT to generate
- [[retrieval utility should drive design over capture completeness]] — schema templates are retrieval-first: the fields you capture are the fields you'll query
- [[skills encode methodology so manual execution bypasses quality gates]] — skills implement schema templates: standardized sections externalize methodology as structure
- [[good descriptions layer heuristic then mechanism then implication]] — a specific schema for descriptions; the layering formula reduces cognitive overhead for description-writing
- [[guided notes might outperform post-hoc structuring for high-volume capture]] — complementary intervention for streaming content: while schema templates specify WHAT fields to record, guided notes specify HOW to organize incoming flow during real-time capture
- [[logic column pattern separates reasoning from procedure]] — concrete application: the `> [!logic]` callout format is a schema template for technical content where the structure (insert logic callout at each step) is given so attention focuses on articulating the reasoning
- [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]] — why templates matter: each template field is an independent facet in Ranganathan's framework, and templates manage the cognitive cost of populating multiple independent classification dimensions at capture time
- [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] — extends the schema template principle from capture to derivation: the four adaptation dimensions (temporal dynamics, ethical requirements, collaboration patterns, retrieval needs) function as a derivation-time schema template that narrows open-ended domain comparison into structured axes, reducing cognitive overhead for the derivation agent
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] — the linguistic complement: schema templates reduce structural overhead by providing pre-defined fields, but field names must also speak the domain's language to reduce linguistic overhead; a template with correctly structured but abstractly named fields still forces translation at every interaction
- [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]] — the temporal complement: schema templates provide the minimal starting point (two to three required fields), and the evolution protocol governs how that starting point grows through observed usage patterns rather than upfront design; templates start small precisely so the system can observe what earns formalization
- [[configuration paralysis emerges when derivation surfaces too many decisions]] — the same cognitive overhead principle applied at the system design level: templates reduce capture decisions through pre-defined fields, configuration defaults reduce derivation decisions through sensible inference; both recognize that cognitive bandwidth spent on structural choices leaves less for substantive ones
- [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]] — explains why schema templates carry disproportionate design weight: the five-component note architecture is domain-invariant except for YAML field names, so the template's field choices are literally the only surface through which domain knowledge enters the note format
