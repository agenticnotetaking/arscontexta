# memory-architecture

The three-space architecture: notes/ (domain knowledge), self/ (agent identity), ops/ (operational scaffolding). Why boundaries matter, what happens when they dissolve, and how to detect boundary violations.

## Core Ideas

### Guidance
- [[build automatic memory through cognitive offloading and session handoffs]] -- How to build automatic memory systems that compound over time — cognitive offloading as foundation, the retrieval bottle

## Tensions

(Capture conflicts as they emerge)

## Open Questions

- When is self/ genuinely needed vs when does ops/ suffice?
- How do three-space boundaries interact with semantic search?
