# novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting

The derivation process works cleanly when the target domain matches a reference domain — research, therapy, learning, projects, personal life, relationships, or creative work. But most real use cases do not fit neatly into these categories. A beekeeping colony management system, a wine tasting journal, a legal case tracker — these are novel domains where no reference model exists to load directly. The question is how the derivation agent handles domains it has never seen.

The answer is analogy by knowledge type. Every domain produces a characteristic kind of knowledge, and that knowledge type maps to a reference domain that handles similar material. Six categories cover the space: factual assertions map to research-like processing, emotional or experiential content maps to therapy-like processing, skill and competency tracking maps to learning-like processing, bounded outcomes map to project-like processing, people and social dynamics map to relationship-like processing, and creative artifacts map to creative-like processing. The mapping is not arbitrary — it follows from what the process step needs to do with the content. Since [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]], the entire derivation challenge for novel domains reduces to designing the right process step, and knowledge type classification identifies which existing process step to start from.

This works because the knowledge type determines what operations produce value. Factual assertions need extraction, verification, and synthesis — the same operations research performs. Experiential content needs pattern detection across temporal entries — what therapy processing does. Competency content needs prerequisite mapping and progression tracking — what learning systems handle. The knowledge type is not a superficial label but a functional classification that predicts which processing patterns will serve the domain. When this classification step is skipped, the result is what [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]] describes — the derivation agent defaults to whatever processing logic it knows best, typically research-style claim extraction, regardless of whether the domain's knowledge type calls for it.

The second step is where the real design happens: identifying what is different about this domain compared to its reference. Because [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]], the adaptation step benefits from the same principle — instead of asking "how is this domain different?" open-endedly, four dimensions of difference consistently matter, functioning as a derivation-time schema that narrows the design space. Temporal dynamics vary — a trading journal needs daily processing while a genealogy database changes monthly. Ethical requirements vary — companion animal care and health tracking demand sensitivity that equipment maintenance does not. Collaboration patterns vary — team sports analytics is inherently multi-agent while a personal garden journal is single-operator. Retrieval patterns vary — a recipe collection needs ingredient-based search while a research vault needs connection-based traversal. Each difference drives specific adaptations to the reference domain's configuration.

The beekeeping example from the source makes this concrete. Colony management produces observational data (inspection records, health indicators) plus equipment management tasks — closest to a project-health hybrid. The reference gives initial settings: project-like capture templates, health-like trend detection in the process step. But beekeeping diverges from pure project management in temporal dynamics (weekly inspections, monthly trends, seasonal cycles rather than sprint-based deadlines), in schema requirements (colony_id, queen_status, brood_pattern rather than task_status, assignee), and in navigation structure (per-colony entity MOCs rather than per-project folders). Since [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]], this reshaping is semantic rather than mechanical — "colony_id" is not just "task_id" renamed but encodes the domain's ontological commitment that colonies are the primary entity, which changes how the system organizes, queries, and reasons about its content.

Since [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]], adaptation cannot treat each dimension independently. Changing the temporal dynamics from sprint-based to seasonal cascades through maintenance cadence (seasonal analysis requires quarterly deep reviews), navigation depth (seasonal overviews need an extra hierarchy layer), and schema density (weather and temperature fields add capture friction that must be weighed against analysis value). The reference domain provides a coherent starting configuration — since [[methodology traditions are named points in a shared configuration space not competing paradigms]], reference domains function like traditions, each a pre-validated point where dimension interactions have been resolved. Adaptation from a coherent starting point is safer than constructing a novel configuration from raw dimensions, because the starting point already satisfies the coupling constraints that [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]] defines.

Since [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]], the analogy-based approach produces justification chains just as direct derivation does. The justification chain for a beekeeping system traces: "colony management is closest to project-health hybrid (knowledge type classification) → project processing handles bounded outcomes with status tracking (reference domain rationale) → but seasonal cycles replace sprint timelines (temporal adaptation) → therefore maintenance cadence shifts to weekly-monthly-seasonal (cascading dimension adjustment) → colony entity MOCs provide per-unit navigation (structural adaptation from the project pattern's per-project MOCs)." Each step in the chain is traceable and debatable, unlike a template that just hands you a beekeeping folder structure without explaining why.

The knowledge type classification also surfaces the upstream storage-versus-thinking decision. Since [[storage versus thinking distinction determines which tool patterns apply]], a novel domain's knowledge type reveals which system type it needs. Equipment inventory management produces factual assertions about what exists where — but the purpose is filing and retrieval (storage), not synthesis (thinking). A wine tasting journal produces experiential content — but the purpose might be personal reflection (thinking) or just record-keeping (storage). The classification doesn't determine the answer, but it narrows the reference domain candidates and the configuration region before detailed derivation begins.

The shadow side is that the six-category classification may be too coarse. Since [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]], Ranganathan's insight applies to domains as well as notes: any mono-classification discards information about every dimension except the one chosen. Real domains often produce multiple knowledge types — beekeeping involves factual observations (research-like), temporal patterns (therapy-like), equipment tracking (project-like), and community knowledge sharing (relationship-like). When a domain spans categories, the derivation agent must either choose the dominant type and treat others as secondary, or compose multiple reference domains — which is the multi-domain composition problem, a genuinely harder challenge. The classification works best when one knowledge type clearly dominates. When types are balanced, the mapping becomes a judgment call rather than an algorithm, and the justification chain for that judgment matters more than the choice itself.

There is also a bootstrapping tension. The six categories emerge from the seven reference domains, which themselves were identified through practice rather than formal analysis. Since [[basic level categorization determines optimal MOC granularity]], Rosch's prototype theory raises the question of whether these six categories sit at the right level of abstraction — they need to be specific enough to predict useful processing patterns while general enough to cover the space. As the vault encounters genuinely novel domains and adapts reference patterns for them, the categories themselves might need revision — a domain that fits none of the six well might reveal a seventh knowledge type, or expertise deepening might make the current categories feel too coarse, just as MOC granularity shifts with understanding. The classification is a working tool, not a finished taxonomy. Its value comes from making the analogy step explicit and justifiable, not from being exhaustive.

Relevant Notes:
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — the parent process this concretizes: derivation traverses the claim graph, and this note specifies the entry procedure when the domain has no direct reference model
- [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]] — the skeleton this note relies on: novel domains inherit capture, connect, and verify as constants, so the analogy-mapping focuses entirely on designing the process step
- [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]] — the dimensions the reference domain provides initial settings for, which adaptation then adjusts based on domain-specific differences
- [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]] — constrains adaptation: changing one dimension to fit the novel domain cascades through others, so adaptation must respect coupling rather than tweaking dimensions independently
- [[methodology traditions are named points in a shared configuration space not competing paradigms]] — reference domains function like methodology traditions: each is a pre-validated coherence point that serves as a starting seed rather than a template to copy
- [[storage versus thinking distinction determines which tool patterns apply]] — the upstream classification that narrows which reference domains are even candidates: a storage-oriented novel domain maps to project-like or personal-life-like patterns, not research-like
- [[faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents]] — the formal framework for why mono-classification fails for multi-type domains: Ranganathan's insight that any single axis discards information about all others applies to the six-category knowledge type scheme when domains produce multiple types
- [[basic level categorization determines optimal MOC granularity]] — Rosch's prototype theory provides the cognitive science framework for evaluating whether the six categories sit at the right abstraction level, and predicts that the optimal resolution shifts as expertise deepens
- [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]] — the four adaptation dimensions function as a derivation-time schema template: instead of open-ended domain comparison, pre-defined axes narrow the design space and reduce cognitive load during adaptation
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] — the vocabulary adaptation mandate: each label substitution in the beekeeping example (sprint to inspection cycle, milestone to seasonal goal) is a semantic mapping governed by this principle, not mechanical find-and-replace
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] — the multi-type domain problem restated: when a novel domain spans knowledge types (factual + experiential + project-like), the mapping challenge becomes a multi-domain composition problem where the derivation must compose reference domains rather than select one
- [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]] — the failure mode this note's classification step prevents: when knowledge type classification is skipped, the derivation agent defaults to whatever processing logic it knows best, producing domain-mismatched operations that feel principled but are semantically empty
- [[justification chains enable forward backward and evolution reasoning about configuration decisions]] — each analogy-mapping step (knowledge type classification, reference domain selection, adaptation rationale) is a link in the justification chain, making the novel domain derivation traceable and debatable rather than opaque; the beekeeping example in the body text demonstrates this chain structure explicitly
