# stigmergy coordinates agents through environmental traces without direct communication

Termites build cathedrals without architects. No termite knows the plan. Each one responds to local conditions — the shape of existing structure, the concentration of chemical traces left by other termites — and adds to the structure accordingly. The result is coordination without communication, complexity without central control. Pierre-Paul Grassé named this mechanism stigmergy in 1959: the environment mediates between agents, and the traces left by one agent's work become the stimulus for the next agent's action.

This is exactly how agent-operated knowledge systems coordinate. When one agent writes a thinking note, adds wiki links, updates a MOC, and advances the work queue, those modifications to the vault environment become the stimulus for the next agent. The next agent doesn't receive a message from the first — it reads the environment. The note exists in `01_thinking/`. The MOC lists it under Core Ideas. The queue entry shows `current_phase: "reflect"`. These are pheromone traces. The second agent responds to the structure, not to a directive. And because [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]], this is not a workaround for agents lacking persistent memory — it is the natural expression of offloading coordination state to the environment, the same architectural pattern that justifies externalizing working memory to files, now applied to inter-agent coordination. The traces split into two distinct classes: since [[operational memory and knowledge memory serve different functions in agent architecture]], queue state and task files are operational stigmergy with temporal value (they coordinate work and expire when processing completes), while wiki links and MOC updates are knowledge stigmergy with compounding value (they build understanding that deepens with every new connection).

The analogy is precise, not metaphorical. Wikipedia coordinates thousands of editors through stigmergy — the article itself is the coordination medium. No editor messages every other editor before making a change. They read the current state, modify it, and leave. The talk page and edit history are environmental traces that inform subsequent editors. Ward Cunningham's wiki design embedded stigmergic coordination into the medium itself — and his distinction between ThreadMode and DocumentMode names a specific transition in stigmergic quality: since [[ThreadMode to DocumentMode transformation is the core value creation step]], raw stigmergic deposits (chronological contributions without coordination) must be synthesized into timeless documents, and this transformation is what turns trace accumulation into genuine knowledge. Since [[federated wiki pattern enables multi-agent divergence as feature not bug]], federation extends this further: agents leave parallel traces rather than forcing convergence, and the divergent traces themselves become navigable structure for future agents.

What makes stigmergy powerful for agent systems is that it solves the coordination problem without requiring persistent identity or direct messaging. Since [[session handoff creates continuity without persistent memory]], each agent session is ephemeral — it exists, acts, and disappears. But the environmental traces persist. Task files accumulate notes from each phase. Queue entries track state. Wiki links weave the knowledge graph tighter. The vault remembers what no individual agent can. This is why [[fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases]] — session isolation is not a limitation to work around but a design that makes stigmergy the coordination primitive. When phases cannot share context, they must coordinate entirely through environmental modification, and environmental modification scales better than context passing ever could.

The vault's hook system mechanizes stigmergic responses. Since [[hook composition creates emergent methodology from independent single-concern components]], hooks are automated reactions to environmental events: a file write triggers validation, validation triggers auto-commit, auto-commit creates a versioned trace. No hook communicates with any other hook. Each responds to the environmental state it finds. The emergent quality pipeline — write, validate, commit — is stigmergic coordination in miniature. And since [[auto-commit hooks eliminate prospective memory failures by converting remember-to-act into guaranteed execution]], the environmental modification (git commit) happens as an automatic response to the trigger (file change), removing even the need for agent awareness.

Stigmergic coordination has a deep structural advantage over message-passing coordination: it follows [[complex systems evolve from simple working systems]]. No agent needs to understand the global state. Each responds to local conditions — the current contents of a file, the current state of a queue entry, the current shape of the graph. Global coordination emerges from accumulated local responses. This is why the vault's architecture scales: adding a fifth concurrent claim-worker doesn't require updating a coordination protocol. The new worker reads the environment (queue, locks, existing notes) and acts accordingly. The environment IS the protocol.

The substrate matters, and since [[four abstraction layers separate platform-agnostic from platform-dependent knowledge system features]], the layers predict which stigmergic traces are universally accessible. Foundation-layer traces (wiki links, folder structure, YAML frontmatter) work for any LLM with filesystem access. Convention-layer traces (naming patterns, quality standards in context files) work for any platform that loads instructions. But automation-layer traces (hook-triggered responses, validation results) and orchestration-layer traces (queue state, team coordination) require platform-specific infrastructure, which means stigmergic coordination itself has a portability gradient: the most basic coordination is universally accessible, while sophisticated coordination patterns narrow the set of participating agents. Since [[local-first file formats are inherently agent-native]], the foundation-layer traces are plain text files that any LLM can read and modify. No database schema, no API authentication, no message broker. The pheromone is markdown. The nest is a folder structure. Any agent with filesystem access can participate in the stigmergic loop at the foundation level. This is precisely why [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]] — wiki links are the primary pheromone format, and their "without infrastructure" property is what makes vault stigmergy universally accessible at its base layer.

There is a shadow side. Stigmergic coordination is robust to agent loss (the knowledge is in the environment, not in any agent) but vulnerable to environmental corruption. If a task file is malformed, every subsequent agent inherits the corruption. If a queue entry points to a nonexistent file, the coordination breaks. In biological stigmergy, pheromone traces evaporate — there's natural garbage collection. In digital stigmergy, traces persist indefinitely unless explicitly cleaned. This means maintenance becomes essential: stale traces accumulate, outdated queue entries mislead, abandoned lock files block. The vault addresses this through its maintenance pipeline (/review, /rethink) and archive practices, but the fundamental vulnerability remains — the environment must be trustworthy because agents trust the environment unconditionally. Since [[wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references]], trust in the environment is not just assumed but structurally earned: the social contract ensures that traces carry obligation, so dangling links are not merely informational pheromones but commitments that the pipeline systematically fulfills.

Stigmergy also compounds through bootstrapping. Since [[bootstrapping principle enables self-improving systems]], each agent's environmental modifications improve the substrate for subsequent agents. A note with three wiki links attracts more connections than a note with none, because the links serve as traces that guide future agents toward related content — and since [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]], the stigmergic traces are precisely the edges that create compounding returns. The economics of link density ARE the economics of stigmergic coordination: denser traces mean richer stimulus for the next agent. Since [[incremental formalization happens through repeated touching of old notes]], each maintenance pass leaves traces (sharpened descriptions, added links, updated metadata) that make the next pass more productive. And since [[backlinks implicitly define notes by revealing usage context]], the accumulated incoming links from many agents across many sessions extend a note's meaning beyond what any single author intended — each backlink is a stigmergic trace that adds to the note's implicit definition without any agent coordinating with any other about what to link. The environment doesn't just coordinate — it improves through coordination. And since [[the vault constitutes identity for agents]], this compounding has an existential dimension: each stigmergic trace does not merely improve the substrate but constitutes the agent that will read it. The next session's identity is literally built from the traces the previous sessions left. Stigmergy is not just how agents coordinate — it is how agent identity accretes across sessions. And since [[scaffolding enables divergence that fine-tuning cannot]], agents operating in different stigmergic environments accumulate different traces, develop different retrieval neighborhoods, and build different traversal intuitions — making the stigmergic medium the primary mechanism through which agent divergence occurs in practice.

The deepest implication is architectural. If the vault is the coordination medium and agents coordinate through traces rather than messages, then vault design IS coordination design. The folder structure, the wiki link conventions, the YAML schema, the queue format — these aren't just organizational choices. They define the pheromone language. They determine what traces agents can leave and what traces they can respond to. Getting the trace format right matters more than getting the agent logic right, because a well-designed environment can coordinate mediocre agents, while a poorly designed environment will frustrate excellent ones. This is why [[the system is the argument]] reaches its most concrete expression through stigmergy: the vault demonstrates its methodology by being stigmergically coordinated, and the traces themselves — the notes, the links, the MOC updates — constitute both the argument and the proof of work.

The stigmergic principle extends beyond reactive trace-following into proactive territory. Since [[hook-driven learning loops create self-improving methodology through observation accumulation]], the observation-to-rethink loop is stigmergy applied to methodology evolution: observations are traces left by one session that become stimulus for a future rethink phase, with no direct communication between the observing agent and the revising agent. And since [[programmable notes could enable property-triggered workflows]], the paradigm can evolve further — from agents responding to traces they discover toward notes actively soliciting attention based on their properties. A note whose staleness threshold has expired, or whose connection count is anomalously low, can surface itself for maintenance. This is the transition from reactive stigmergy (termites responding to pheromone concentrations) to anticipatory stigmergy (traces that encode when they should next be attended to).
