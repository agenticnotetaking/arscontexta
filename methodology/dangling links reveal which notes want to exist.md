# dangling links reveal which notes want to exist

The insight: dangling links are not errors to fix immediately. They are signals to monitor. Each dangling link represents a concept someone thought was important enough to reference. When multiple notes independently reference the same non-existent concept, that frequency reveals demand.

## The mechanism

Link freely during capture. Don't worry about whether the target note exists yet. The act of linking expresses: "this concept matters here, and deserves its own treatment." But since [[wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references]], this act carries more weight than simple signal generation — each link is a commitment that the target concept will eventually be elaborated, and the vault's integrity depends on those commitments being honored through the maintenance pipeline.

Dangling links accumulate independently across different notes. A concept referenced from three different contexts has more demand than one referenced once. Frequency analysis reveals which placeholder concepts deserve their own notes.

When the demanded note is finally created, all dangling links become live connections instantly. The graph weaves itself retroactively.

Since [[orphan notes are seeds not failures]], the inverse pattern complements this one. Dangling links are future inbound connections waiting for their target note to exist. Orphan notes are future outbound connections waiting for maintenance passes to discover where they belong. Both are intermediate states in incremental graph construction — the graph doesn't need to be complete at any moment, only growing toward completeness.

## Structural prediction

High-frequency dangling links predict future MOC candidates. If ten notes link to [concept X] before it exists, when you finally create [concept X], it immediately has ten incoming connections. That's hub-level link density. The concept was already functioning as a hub before it had a body.

This is how notes enter the graph with pre-accumulated value. Since [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]], a note with ten incoming links on day one doesn't just add one node — it creates ten new traversal paths that make the existing graph more navigable. High-frequency dangling links predict not just future hubs but future value multipliers.

This is organic graph growth: structure emerges from use patterns rather than imposed categories. Since [[complex systems evolve from simple working systems]], the graph that grows through dangling link resolution has been pressure-tested by actual reference patterns — unlike a designed taxonomy that guesses what concepts matter before they prove their value. This matters for how [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]] will function in the future. A note that enters the graph with ten incoming links immediately becomes a high-activation node that primes many related concepts simultaneously.

## How dangling links extend wiki link addressing

Since [[wiki links implement GraphRAG without the infrastructure]] through explicit edges, dangling links add a complementary demand signal. Together they create a system where:

1. You link to concepts as if they exist
2. Frequency reveals which concepts should exist
3. Creation of demanded notes instantly weaves the graph
4. Hub topology emerges from genuine reference patterns

The graph grows through use, not through planning. This is retrieval-first architecture applied to graph growth: since [[retrieval utility should drive design over capture completeness]], demand signals (dangling link frequency) determine structure rather than upfront planning.

## Predicting future hubs from link frequency

High-frequency dangling links predict which notes will become hubs. Because [[small-world topology requires hubs and dense local links]], a note that has ten incoming links on creation day starts with hub-level connectivity. The topology self-organizes around concepts that multiple contexts reference. This forward-looking prediction complements what [[betweenness centrality identifies bridge notes connecting disparate knowledge domains]] measures for existing nodes — dangling link frequency predicts where new structural importance will emerge, while betweenness centrality identifies where it already exists. Together they provide a complete temporal picture: what the graph wants to become and what it currently is.

The "notes that want" framing extends beyond existence. Since [[programmable notes could enable property-triggered workflows]], notes can want attention (staleness thresholds), want review (due dates), want connection (link density below threshold). Dangling links wanting resolution is one instance of a broader pattern: metadata conditions that trigger surfacing behavior.

- [[throughput matters more than accumulation]] — dangling link frequency operationalizes throughput metrics: process what has demonstrated demand
- [[each new note compounds value by creating traversal paths]] — explains WHY pre-accumulated links matter: notes with many incoming connections multiply graph value on creation
- [[retrieval utility should drive design over capture completeness]] — demand-driven structure (dangling link frequency) is retrieval-first design: let use patterns reveal what deserves notes, not upfront planning
- [[orphan notes are seeds not failures]] — the inverse pattern: dangling links are future inbound connections, orphan notes are future outbound connections; both are intermediate states in incremental graph growth
- [[associative ontologies beat hierarchical taxonomies because heterarchy adapts while hierarchy brittles]] — grounds the theory: organic structure from link patterns is heterarchy in action, avoiding the brittleness of upfront classification
- [[complex systems evolve from simple working systems]] — theoretical foundation: Gall's Law explains WHY organic graph growth works — structure that emerges from use patterns has been tested by use, unlike designed-from-scratch systems that fail before validation
- [[betweenness centrality identifies bridge notes connecting disparate knowledge domains]] — demand-side complement: dangling link frequency predicts future hubs by reference frequency, betweenness centrality identifies existing hubs by structural position; together they provide forward-looking and backward-looking graph analysis
- [[wiki links as social contract transforms agents into stewards of incomplete references]] — adds the ethical dimension this note's demand-signal framing omits: creating a dangling link is not just flagging statistical demand but making a deliberate commitment to future elaboration, reframing frequency-based prioritization as obligation-based stewardship
