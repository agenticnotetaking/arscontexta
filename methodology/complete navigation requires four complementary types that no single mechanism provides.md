# complete navigation requires four complementary types that no single mechanism provides

Rosenfeld and Morville's information architecture taxonomy identifies four navigation types that compose into complete wayfinding: global (where am I in the whole?), local (what's nearby?), contextual (what's related to THIS?), and supplemental (how else can I find things?). The critical insight is not the taxonomy itself but the complementarity — each type answers a question the others cannot, so any system relying on a single mechanism has predictable blind spots.

In this vault, each type maps onto a distinct mechanism. Global navigation lives in the hub (`index.md`) and domain MOCs, which orient the agent to the full scope of the knowledge graph. Local navigation lives in topic MOCs, which present the neighborhood of a domain — core ideas, tensions, gaps — in one view. But the depth to which local navigation can stack tiers depends on label quality: since [[context phrase clarity determines how deep a navigation hierarchy can scale]], deeper MOC hierarchies only outperform flatter ones when context phrases enable confident branch commitment at each tier. Contextual navigation lives in inline wiki links, which connect THIS note to THAT note with prose explaining why the relationship matters. Supplemental navigation lives in search — both keyword (`grep`) and semantic (`qmd`) — which provides entry points independent of the curated graph structure.

The four types reveal why partial systems fail in characteristic ways. A system with only search (supplemental) cannot orient agents within a domain because there is no curated map of what matters. Since [[navigational vertigo emerges in pure association systems without local hierarchy]], a system with only inline links (contextual) leaves semantically related but unlinked content unreachable. A system with only MOCs (local) provides neighborhood maps but no way to discover connections across neighborhoods. And a system with only a hub (global) gives high-altitude orientation without the detail to work within any topic.

The vault's four mechanisms cover all four types, but coverage is not the same as quality. Since [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]], each navigation type requires its own maintenance cadence. Global navigation changes rarely (new domains are infrequent). Local navigation changes with every batch of new claims (MOC updates during `/reflect`). Contextual navigation changes with every new note (inline links during creation and `/reweave`). Supplemental navigation changes with index freshness (`qmd update`). Because [[three concurrent maintenance loops operate at different timescales to catch different classes of problems]], the per-type cadence maps naturally onto the loop architecture: fast loops catch contextual navigation failures (broken links on every write), medium loops catch local navigation drift (orphan notes surfaced per session), and slow loops audit global navigation structure (domain MOC coherence over weeks). Neglecting maintenance on any single type degrades the system's completeness even when the other three remain healthy.

This framework also explains why [[structure enables navigation without reading everything]] works as well as it does — the four discovery layers (file tree, descriptions, headings, full content) are not arbitrary but map onto the navigation types. File tree scanning provides global orientation. MOC reading provides local orientation. Following wiki links provides contextual depth. Searching provides supplemental discovery. The progressive disclosure pattern succeeds because it exercises all four navigation types in sequence, ensuring no blind spots in the agent's orientation.

The framework also provides the theoretical grounding for why specific knowledge system primitives are universal. Since [[ten universal primitives form the kernel of every viable agent knowledge system]], four of those primitives — wiki links, MOC hierarchy, tree injection, and description fields — correspond directly to the four navigation types. Wiki links implement contextual navigation, MOCs implement local navigation, tree injection implements global navigation, and descriptions enable supplemental discovery by providing filterable metadata. The primitives are universal precisely because each addresses a navigation type that no other primitive covers. Removing any one creates a predictable blind spot, which is why the kernel cannot be reduced further without losing navigation completeness.

The practical test for any agent knowledge architecture: can you answer all four questions? Where am I? What's nearby? What's related to this? How else can I find things? If any question goes unanswered, the architecture has a gap that will manifest as a navigation failure at scale. Since [[navigation infrastructure passes through distinct scaling regimes that require qualitative strategy shifts]], the urgency of this test increases with vault size — at Regime 1 the blind spots are tolerable because the agent can hold everything in context, but by Regime 2 an unanswered navigation question becomes an active impediment. And because [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]], the navigation depth dimension is really a choice about how many of these four types to support, which means the completeness test doubles as a design evaluation tool for any derived knowledge system.

Relevant Notes:
- [[structure enables navigation without reading everything]] — develops the four structural mechanisms (wiki links, MOCs, claim titles, descriptions) as discovery layers; this note reframes those same mechanisms through the navigation type taxonomy, showing they cover all four types
- [[navigational vertigo emerges in pure association systems without local hierarchy]] — describes the failure mode when local navigation (MOCs) is absent from a system that only has contextual navigation (links); the four-type framework predicts exactly this gap
- [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]] — explains HOW agents move through the graph; this note explains WHAT structural roles the mechanisms play, so spreading activation is the traversal engine while navigation types are the road system
- [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]] — adds a second payoff for the local navigation layer: MOCs provide not just nearby-content orientation but attention cost reduction, making the local type doubly justified
- [[stale navigation actively misleads because agents trust curated maps completely]] — the failure mode when any navigation type degrades: stale MOCs corrupt local navigation, stale links corrupt contextual navigation, and agents cannot distinguish fresh from stale
- [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]] — the navigation depth dimension is a design choice about how many navigation types to support; the four-type framework explains WHY depth matters by mapping each level to a type that answers a question the others cannot
- [[ten universal primitives form the kernel of every viable agent knowledge system]] — four kernel primitives (wiki links, MOC hierarchy, tree injection, description fields) correspond to the four navigation types, explaining why these specific primitives are universal: each provides a navigation capability that the others cannot replace
- [[three concurrent maintenance loops operate at different timescales to catch different classes of problems]] — the per-type maintenance cadence maps onto the three-loop architecture: fast loops maintain contextual navigation (link integrity per event), medium loops maintain local navigation (MOC updates per session), slow loops maintain global navigation (domain structure per audit cycle)
- [[navigation infrastructure passes through distinct scaling regimes that require qualitative strategy shifts]] — extends: scaling regimes explain WHEN the four types become necessary; at Regime 1 all four are premature, at Regime 2 local and contextual become essential, at Regime 3 all four plus automation are required
- [[context phrase clarity determines how deep a navigation hierarchy can scale]] — depth constraint on local navigation: the local type (MOCs) can sustain multiple tiers only when context phrases enable confident branch commitment; ambiguous labels cap the depth at which local navigation remains effective
- [[MOC construction forces synthesis that automated generation from metadata cannot replicate]] — quality mechanism for local navigation: the local type requires curated MOCs, and the Dump-Lump-Jump synthesis is what produces the orientation and context phrase quality that distinguishes genuine local navigation from automated link lists
