# faceted classification treats notes as multi-dimensional objects rather than folder contents

S.R. Ranganathan's Colon Classification system, developed in the 1930s for library science, provides the formal theoretical basis for what this vault does with flat folders and YAML metadata. His PMEST framework — Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time — treats every document as a multi-dimensional object that can be sliced along independent classification axes. The core insight is that no single axis captures what a document IS, so any system that forces a choice of one axis (like a folder hierarchy) necessarily destroys information about the others.

This matters because folder hierarchies are mono-hierarchical by nature. A file lives in one folder. You can choose to organize by topic, by type, by date, by source — but you must pick one, and that choice becomes the only efficient retrieval path. Everything else requires searching. Since [[associative ontologies beat hierarchical taxonomies because heterarchy adapts while hierarchy brittles]], the vault already rejects mono-hierarchy in favor of emergent link structure. Faceted classification provides the formal justification for this choice: it's not just that heterarchy is more flexible, it's that mono-classification provably discards information about every dimension except the one you chose.

The YAML frontmatter system implements faceted classification directly. Each metadata field is a facet — an independent classification dimension:

| Facet | YAML Field | What It Classifies |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Content kind | `type` | claim, methodology, tension, problem |
| Disciplinary origin | `methodology` | Zettelkasten, Evergreen, Cornell, etc. |
| Topic membership | `topics` | Which MOC(s) the note belongs to |
| Graph position | `role` | moc, hub, leaf, synthesis |
| Development stage | `status` | preliminary, open, dissolved |

Since [[type field enables structured queries without folder hierarchies]], type metadata already demonstrates one facet in operation — agents can query "all methodology notes" without folder structure. But type is just one dimension. The power of faceted classification is that dimensions compose multiplicatively. "All methodology notes about Zettelkasten" combines type and methodology facets. "All open tensions in graph-structure" combines status, type, and topics. Each facet independently narrows the search space, and since [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]], the entropy reduction from combining facets is roughly multiplicative — two facets with 5 values each reduce search space by ~25x, not ~10x.

The faceted perspective also explains why since [[role field makes graph structure explicit]] represents a genuinely new dimension rather than redundant metadata. Role (graph position) is orthogonal to type (content kind) because a claim can be a leaf or a hub, a synthesis can be well-connected or isolated. Ranganathan's framework predicts this: facets that represent genuinely independent properties of the object add retrieval power, while facets that correlate with existing ones add noise. The test for whether a new YAML field is justified is whether it classifies along an axis independent of existing fields. And since [[basic level categorization determines optimal MOC granularity]], Rosch's prototype theory adds a complementary prediction: on each axis, the values should sit at basic-level resolution — specific enough to filter meaningfully but general enough to group useful clusters, with that optimal resolution shifting as expertise deepens.

For agents specifically, faceted classification transforms how retrieval works. Instead of "what folder does this live in?" the agent asks "what are the attributes of this?" — and can enter from any facet. An agent seeking tension notes traverses the type facet. An agent seeking Zettelkasten-origin claims traverses the methodology facet. An agent seeking notes in graph-structure traverses the topics facet. Each facet provides a different entry point into the same set of notes, because since [[concept-orientation beats source-orientation for cross-domain connections]], extracted concept nodes can participate in multiple classification dimensions simultaneously. Source-bundled documents can only be classified meaningfully by origin — one facet, one entry point.

The historical depth here is significant. Ranganathan developed faceted classification in 1930s India specifically because the Library of Congress and Dewey Decimal systems — both mono-hierarchical — failed to classify Indian texts that didn't fit Western academic categories. The breakdown happened because mono-hierarchies encode assumptions about how knowledge is organized, and those assumptions are culturally specific. Faceted classification was the solution: instead of asking "which Western category does this fit?" ask "what are its independent properties?" This translates directly to knowledge vaults. The question isn't "which folder?" but "what are its attributes?" — and the YAML frontmatter system makes those attributes queryable.

There's a tension, though. More facets means more metadata ceremony at capture time. Since [[topological organization beats temporal for knowledge work]] is a closed design decision, the vault already commits to minimal folder structure. But each new facet field added to the template increases the cost of note creation. Ranganathan's insight cuts both ways: facets are powerful precisely because they're independent, but independence means each must be classified separately. The vault's current approach — making most fields optional, defaulting type to claim — manages this by requiring only the most useful facets (description, topics) while leaving others available when they'd add retrieval value. And since [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]], the decision about which facets to require is not made upfront but driven by usage evidence — when agents repeatedly add a classification dimension manually, that repetition is the signal to formalize it as a template field. Faceted classification theory explains WHY independent dimensions have retrieval value; the evolution protocol determines WHEN each dimension earns its place in the schema.

The faceted framework also predicts how multi-domain systems compose. Since [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]], domain membership itself becomes another facet — a classification dimension orthogonal to topic, type, and methodology. An agent querying "all therapy domain notes that connect to research claims" is executing a cross-facet query across the domain dimension and the type dimension simultaneously, which is exactly the multiplicative retrieval that Ranganathan's framework enables. Multi-domain composition does not require new organizational machinery — it requires recognizing that "which domain produced this" is just another independent property of a multi-dimensional object.

The deeper lesson from faceted classification is that the "where does this go?" question is fundamentally wrong for knowledge systems. Notes don't GO anywhere. They HAVE properties. The organizational scheme that emerges from those properties -- flat files queryable across independent dimensions -- is what Ranganathan formalized ninety years ago, and what this vault implements with markdown files and YAML frontmatter. This faceted access is one of four layers that since [[markdown plus YAML plus ripgrep implements a queryable graph database without infrastructure]] compose into a system with graph database capabilities: wiki link edges for traversal, YAML fields for node properties, faceted dimensions for multi-attribute queries, and soft validation for consistency. Ranganathan's framework provides the theoretical grounding for why the query layer works -- independent facets compose multiplicatively, which is the formal justification for why ripgrep piped through multiple YAML field filters achieves the same multi-attribute precision that graph database query languages provide through WHERE clause conjunction.

Relevant Notes:
- [[markdown plus YAML plus ripgrep implements a queryable graph database without infrastructure]] — synthesis: faceted classification is the multi-dimensional access layer of the four-layer graph database architecture; Ranganathan's framework is the theoretical grounding for why piped ripgrep queries achieve graph database multi-attribute precision
- [[associative ontologies beat hierarchical taxonomies because heterarchy adapts while hierarchy brittles]] — foundation: faceted classification is the formal library science articulation of what heterarchy achieves informally through emergent links
- [[type field enables structured queries without folder hierarchies]] — direct implementation: type is one facet dimension; this note provides the theoretical framework that justifies adding orthogonal metadata fields
- [[metadata reduces entropy enabling precision over recall]] — each facet dimension reduces search entropy independently, enabling multiplicative precision gains when facets combine
- [[role field makes graph structure explicit]] — another facet dimension: role describes graph position while type describes content kind, demonstrating that facets are genuinely orthogonal
- [[concept-orientation beats source-orientation for cross-domain connections]] — prerequisite: concept extraction creates the independent nodes that faceted access can slice from multiple angles; source-bundled documents have only one meaningful facet (origin)
- [[topological organization beats temporal for knowledge work]] — temporal filing treats time as the single classification axis; faceted classification explains why that impoverishes retrieval by collapsing dimensionality
- [[retrieval utility should drive design over capture completeness]] — design orientation: faceted classification formalizes what retrieval-first design intuits; 'notes have properties' is the Ranganathan articulation of 'how will I find this' over 'where does this go'
- [[schema templates reduce cognitive overhead at capture time]] — cost management: every facet must be populated at capture time, and templates reduce the cognitive cost of multi-dimensional classification by making structure mechanical rather than creative
- [[question-answer metadata enables inverted search patterns]] — candidate facet: an answers field would add an independent classification dimension (what questions a note answers), and faceted theory provides the test for whether it earns its place as genuinely orthogonal
- [[intermediate representation pattern enables reliable vault operations beyond regex]] — infrastructure: facet queries currently run via regex on raw YAML, which is fragile; an IR layer would make faceted access a property lookup on typed objects, realizing the full composability that Ranganathan's framework promises
- [[navigational vertigo emerges in pure association systems without local hierarchy]] — alternative remedy: beyond MOC hierarchy and link traversal, faceted metadata queries provide a third navigation mechanism that addresses vertigo through structured entry points independent of graph connectivity
- [[basic level categorization determines optimal MOC granularity]] — resolution complement: Ranganathan explains WHICH axes to classify along (facets), Rosch explains what RESOLUTION to target on each axis; together they predict that a well-designed classification uses orthogonal facets at basic-level granularity
- [[narrow folksonomy optimizes for single-operator retrieval unlike broad consensus tagging]] — complementary vocabulary layer: faceted classification provides the structural dimensions (type, methodology, topics) while narrow folksonomy provides the vocabulary within those dimensions; the controlled enum values in YAML fields are the thin consensus layer, while sentence-form titles are pure narrow folksonomy
- [[methodology traditions are named points in a shared configuration space not competing paradigms]] — structural parallel: just as Ranganathan showed documents have independent classification axes rather than single folder assignments, this note shows methodologies have independent configuration dimensions rather than single paradigm labels; both argue against mono-classification
- [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] — concrete case where mono-classification fails for domains: when a domain produces multiple knowledge types (factual + experiential + project-like), the six-category scheme faces exactly the Ranganathan problem — any single axis discards information about others, which is why multi-type domains require either dominant-type selection or multi-reference composition
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] — domain-as-facet: domain membership is an independent classification dimension orthogonal to topic and type, so multi-domain composition is a cross-facet query problem that Ranganathan's framework already solves
- [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]] — temporal complement to faceted theory: Ranganathan explains why independent dimensions have retrieval value, the evolution protocol determines when each dimension earns its place in the schema through observed usage patterns rather than upfront design
